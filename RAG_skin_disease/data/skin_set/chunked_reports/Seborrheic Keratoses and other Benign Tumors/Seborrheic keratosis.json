        "text": "Inverted follicular keratosis\n\n[notes 1]\n\n\n# Differential diagnoses\n\nDermatosis papulosa nigra (DPN) is a condition of many small, benign skin lesions on the face, a condition generally presenting on darker-skinned individuals. [3]:  638-9   DPN is extremely common, affecting up to 30% of black people in the United States. [18]\n\n\n## Treatment\n\nMedical reasons for removing seborrheic keratoses include irritation and bleeding. They may also be removed for  cosmetic  reasons. [4][5]   Generally,  lesions  can  be  treated  with  electrodesiccation  and  curettage,  or cryosurgery.  When  correctly  performed,  removal  of  seborrheic  keratoses  will  not  cause  much  visible scarring. [19]\n\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nSeborrheic  keratosis  is  the  most  common  benign  skin  tumor.  Incidence  increases  with  age.  There  is  less prevalence in people with darker skin. [20]  In large-cohort studies, all patients aged 50 and older had at least one seborrheic keratosis. [21]  Onset is usually in middle age, although they are common in younger patients too,  as  they  are  found  in  12%  of  15-year-olds  to  25-year-olds,  which  makes  the  term  \"senile  keratosis\"  a misnomer. [22]\n\n\n## See also\n\n\n- The sign of Leser-Trélat\n\n\n\n## Notes\n\n\n- Inverted follicular keratosis is generally thought to be a rare variant of seborrheic keratosis, but this position is not universally accepted.\n- Karadag, AyseSerap; Ozlu, Emin; Uzuncakmak, TugbaKevser; Akdeniz, Necmettin; Cobanoglu, Bengu; Oman, Berkant (2016). \"Inverted follicular keratosis successfully treated with imiquimod\" (htt ps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4886589).
