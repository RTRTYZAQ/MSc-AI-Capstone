[2]\n\n\n## Overview\n\nPhotodermatoses can be categorized into primary or secondary photodermatoses based on the cause of the reaction.  Primary  photodermatoses  are  immunology  mediated  or  caused  by  chemical/drug  exposure.  An example  of  primary  photodermatoses  is  Polymorphous  light  eruption.  Polymorphous  light  eruption  is  the most common type of photodermatoses. It is most likely due to an abnormal immune system reaction to the sun.  Polymorphous  light  eruption  occurs  in  approximately  10  to  20  percent [3]   of  otherwise  healthy individuals, so it is a relatively common condition. A more rare photodermatoses is hydroa vacciniforme with a prevalence of 0.34 per 100 000.
