[2]   The  lesions may be painful or itchy. [3]  Fever is uncommon. [3]\n\nIt is typically due to either Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus  pyogenes .

After they break open, they form hard, thick, gray-yellow scabs, which sometimes leave scars.  Ecthyma may be accompanied by swollen lymph nodes in the affected area.
