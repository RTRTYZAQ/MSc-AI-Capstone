Chickenpox and shingles often result in blisters that break open, providing a gap in the skin through which bacteria can enter. Lymphedema, which causes swelling on the arms and/or legs,  can  also  put  an  individual  at  risk.  Diseases  that  affect  blood  circulation  in  the  legs  and  feet,  such  as chronic venous insufficiency and varicose veins, are also risk factors for cellulitis.\n\nCellulitis  is  also  common  among  dense  populations  sharing  hygiene  facilities  and  common  living  quarters, such as military installations, college dormitories, nursing homes, oil platforms, and homeless shelters.\n\n\n## Diagnosis\n\nCellulitis  is  most  often  a  clinical  diagnosis,  readily  identified  in  many  people  by  history  and  physical examination  alone,  with  rapidly  spreading  areas  of  cutaneous  swelling,  redness,  and  heat,  occasionally associated  with  inflammation  of  regional  lymph  nodes.  While  classically  distinguished  as  a  separate  entity from erysipelas by spreading more deeply to involve the subcutaneous tissues, many clinicians may classify erysipelas as cellulitis. Both are often treated similarly, but cellulitis associated with furuncles, carbuncles, or abscesses  is  usually  caused  by S.  aureus ,  which  may  affect  treatment  decisions,  especially  antibiotic selection. [16]   Skin  aspiration  of  nonpurulent  cellulitis,  usually  caused  by  streptococcal  organisms,  is  rarely helpful for diagnosis, and blood cultures are positive in fewer than 5% of all cases. [16]\n\nIt is important to evaluate for co-existent abscess, as this finding usually requires surgical drainage as opposed to antibiotic therapy alone. Physicians' clinical assessment for abscess may be limited, especially in cases with extensive overlying induration, but use of bedside ultrasonography performed by an experienced practitioner readily discriminates between abscess and cellulitis and may change management in up to 56% of cases. [17] Use of ultrasound for abscess identification may also be indicated in cases of antibiotic failure. Cellulitis has a characteristic  \"cobblestoned\"  appearance  indicative  of  subcutaneous  edema  without  a  defined  hypoechoic, heterogeneous fluid collection that would indicate abscess. [18]\n\n\n## Differential diagnosis\n\nOther  conditions  that  may  mimic  cellulitis  include  deep  vein  thrombosis,  which  can  be  diagnosed  with  a compression leg ultrasound, and stasis dermatitis, which is inflammation of the skin from poor blood flow. Signs  of  a  more  severe  infection  such  as  necrotizing  fasciitis  or  gas  gangrene  that  would  require  prompt surgical  intervention  include  purple  bullae,  skin  sloughing,  subcutaneous  edema,  and  systemic  toxicity. [16] Misdiagnosis can occur in up to 30% of people with suspected lower-extremity cellulitis, leading to 50,000 to 130,000 unnecessary hospitalizations and $195 to $515 million in avoidable healthcare spending annually in the United States. [19]  Evaluation by dermatologists for cases of suspected cellulitis has been shown to reduce misdiagnosis rates and improve patient outcomes. [20][21]"

        "text": "Associated musculoskeletal findings are  sometimes  reported.  When  it  occurs  with  acne  conglobata, hidradenitis suppurativa, and pilonidal cysts, the syndrome is referred to as the follicular occlusion triad or tetrad. [22]\n\nLyme disease can be misdiagnosed as cellulitis. The characteristic bullseye rash does not always appear in Lyme  disease  (the  rash  may  not  have  a  central  or  ring-like  clearing,  or  not  appear  at  all). [23]   Factors supportive of Lyme include recent outdoor activities where Lyme is common and rash at an unusual site for cellulitis,  such  as  armpit,  groin,  or  behind  the  knee. [24][23]   Lyme  can  also  result  in  long-term  neurologic complications. [25]  The standard treatment for cellulitis, cephalexin, is not useful in Lyme disease. [5]  When it is unclear which one is present, the IDSA recommends treatment with cefuroxime axetil or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, as these are effective against both infections. [5]\n\n\n# Prevention\n\nIn those who have previously had cellulitis, the use of antibiotics may help prevent future episodes. [26]  This is recommended by Clinical Resource Efficiency Support Team (CREST) for those who have had more than two episodes. [6][27]  A 2017 meta-analysis found a benefit of preventative antibiotics for recurrent cellulitis in the lower limbs, but the preventative effects appear to diminish after stopping antibiotic therapy. [28]\n\n\n## Treatment\n\nAntibiotics  are  usually  prescribed,  with  the  agent  selected  based  on  suspected  organism  and  presence  or absence  of  purulence, [16]   although  the  best  treatment  choice  is  unclear. [29]   If  an  abscess  is  also  present, surgical drainage is usually indicated, with antibiotics often prescribed for co-existent cellulitis, especially if extensive. [17]  Pain relief is also often prescribed, but excessive pain should always be investigated, as it is a symptom of necrotizing fasciitis. Elevation of the affected area is often recommended. [30]\n\nSteroids may speed recovery in those on antibiotics. [1]\n\n\n## Antibiotics\n\nAntibiotics choices depend on regional availability, but a penicillinase-resistant semisynthetic penicillin or a first-generation  cephalosporin  is  currently  recommended  for  cellulitis  without  abscess. [16]   A  course  of antibiotics is not effective in between 6 and 37% of cases. [31]\n\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nCellulitis in 2015 resulted in about 16,900 deaths worldwide, up from 12,600 in 2005. [8]\n\nCellulitis is a common global health burden, with more than 650,000 admissions per year in the United States alone. In the United States, an estimated 14.5 million cases annually of cellulitis account for $3.7 billion in ambulatory care costs alone. The majority of cases of cellulitis are nonculturable and therefore the causative bacteria  are  unknown.  In  the  15%  of  cellulitis  cases  in  which  organisms  are  identified,  most  are  due  to  βhemolytic Streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus. [32]\n\n\n## Other animals\n\nHorses may acquire cellulitis, usually secondarily to a wound (which can be extremely small and superficial) or to a deep-tissue infection, such as an abscess or infected bone, tendon sheath or joint. [33][34]  Cellulitis from a superficial wound usually creates less lameness (grade 1-2 of 5) than that caused by septic arthritis (grade 4-5).  The  horse  exhibits  inflammatory  edema,  which  is  hot,  painful  swelling.  This  swelling  differs  from stocking up in that the horse does not display symmetrical swelling in two or four legs, but in only one leg. This swelling begins near the source of infection, but eventually continues down the leg. In some cases, the swelling  also  travels  distally.  Treatment  includes  cleaning  the  wound  and  caring  for  it  properly,  the administration of NSAIDs, such as phenylbutazone, cold hosing, applying a sweat wrap or a poultice, and mild exercise."
