[1] Symptoms of contact dermatitis can include itchy or dry skin, a red  rash,  bumps,  blisters,  or  swelling.  These  rashes  are  not contagious or life-threatening, but can be very uncomfortable.\n\nContact  dermatitis  results  from  either  exposure  to  allergens (allergic contact dermatitis), or irritants (irritant contact dermatitis). Allergic contact dermatitis involves a delayed type of  hypersensitivity  and  previous  exposure  to  an  allergen  to produce  a  reaction. [2]   Irritant  contact  dermatitis  is  the  most common type and represents 80% of all cases. [1]  It is caused by prolonged exposure to irritants,  leading  to  direct  injury  of  the epidermal cells of the skin, which activates  an  immune response,  resulting  in  an  inflammatory  cutaneous  reaction. [1] Phototoxic  dermatitis  occurs  when  the  allergen  or  irritant  is activated  by  sunlight.  Diagnosis  of  allergic  contact  dermatitis can often be supported by patch testing.

[4]  There are few accurate statistics on the incidence and prevalence of contact dermatitis. [5]  The results of the few studies that have been undertaken cannot be compared because of methodological differences. [5]\n\n\n## Signs and symptoms\n\nContact dermatitis is a localized rash or irritation of the skin caused by contact with a foreign substance. Only the  superficial  regions  of  the  skin  are  affected  in  contact  dermatitis.  Inflammation  of  the  affected  tissue  is present  in  the  epidermis  (the  outermost  layer  of  skin)  and  the  outer  dermis  (the  layer  beneath  the epidermis). [6]\n\nContact dermatitis results in large, burning, and itchy rashes. These can take anywhere from several days to weeks to heal. This differentiates it from contact urticaria (hives), in which a rash appears within minutes of exposure and then fades away within minutes to hours. Even after days, contact dermatitis fades only if the skin no longer comes in contact with the allergen or irritant. [7]  Chronic contact dermatitis can develop when the removal of the offending agent no longer provides expected relief.",

        "text": "The  distinction  between  the  various  types  of  contact  dermatitis  is based  on  a  number  of  factors.  The  morphology  of  the  tissues,  the histology,  and  immunologic findings are all used in diagnosis of the form of the condition. However, as suggested previously, there is some confusion in the distinction of the different forms of contact\n\ndermatitis. [24]   Using  histology  on  its  own  is  insufficient,  as  these  findings  have  been  acknowledged  not  to distinguish, [24]  and even positive patch testing does not rule out the existence of an irritant form of dermatitis as well as an immunological one.\n\n\n# Prevention\n\n\nIn  an  industrial  setting  the  employer  has  a  duty  of  care  to  its  worker  to  provide  the  correct  level  of  safety equipment to mitigate exposure to harmful irritants. This can take the form of protective clothing, gloves, or barrier cream, depending on the working environment. It is impossible to eliminate the complete exposure to harmful irritants but can be avoided using the multidimensional approach. The multidimensional approach includes eight basic elements to follow. They are:\n- Identification of possible cutaneous irritants and allergens\n- To avoid skin exposure, use appropriate control measures or chemical substitutes.\n- Personal protection can be achieved by the use of protective clothes or barrier creams.\n- Maintenance of personal and environmental hygiene\n- Use of harmful irritants in the workplace should be regulated\n- Efforts to raise knowledge of potential allergies and irritants through education\n- promoting safe working conditions and practices\n- health screenings before and after employment and on a regular basis [25]\n\n\nTopical  antibiotics  should  not  be  used  to  prevent  infection  in  wounds  after  surgery. [26][27]   When  they  are used,  it  is  inappropriate,  and  the  person  recovering  from  surgery  is  at  significantly  increased  risk  of developing contact dermatitis. [26]\n\n\n## Treatment\n\n\n## Self-care\n\n\n- If blistering develops, cold moist compresses [ 28 ] applied for 30 minutes, three times a day can offer relief.\n- Calamine lotion may relieve itching. [ 28 ]\n- Oral antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl, Ben-Allergin) can relieve itching. [ 28 ]\n- Avoid scratching. [ 28 ]\n- Immediately after exposure to a known allergen or irritant, wash with soap and cool water to remove or inactivate most of the offending substance."

        "text": "- For mild cases that cover a relatively small area, hydrocortisone cream in nonprescription strength may be sufficient.\n- Weak acid solutions (lemon juice, vinegar) can be used to counteract the effects of dermatitis contracted by exposure to basic irritants.\n- A barrier cream, such as those containing zinc oxide (e.g., Desitin, etc.), may help protect the skin and retain moisture.\n\n\n\n## Medical care\n\nIf  the  rash  does not improve or continues to spread after two to three of days of self-care, or if the itching and/or  pain  is  severe,  the  patient  should  contact  a  dermatologist  or  other  physician.  Medical  treatment usually consists of lotions, creams, or oral medications.\n\n\n- Corticosteroids . A corticosteroid medication like hydrocortisone may be prescribed to combat infl ammation in a localized area. It may be applied to the skin as a cream or ointment. If the reaction covers a relatively large portion of the skin or is severe, a corticosteroid in pill or injection form may be prescribed.\n\n\nIn severe cases, a stronger medicine like halobetasol may be prescribed by a dermatologist.\n\n\n- Antihistamines . Prescription antihistamines may be given if non-prescription strengths are inadequate.\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n\n- Eczema - Inflammatory disease of the skin\n- Hock burns - Leg injuries commonly found in birds raised for meat\n- Nickel allergy\n- Urushiol-induced contact dermatitis"
