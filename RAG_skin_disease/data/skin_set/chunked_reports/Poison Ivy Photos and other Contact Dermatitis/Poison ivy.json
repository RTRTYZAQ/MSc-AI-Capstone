        "text": "# Poison ivy\n\nPoison ivy is  a  type of allergenic plant in the genus Toxicodendron native  to  Asia  and  North  America.  Formerly  considered  a  single species, Toxicodendron  radicans ,  poison  ivies  are  now  generally treated as a complex of three separate species: T. radicans , T.  rydbergii ,  and T.  orientale .  They  are  variable  in  appearance  and habit, and despite its common name, it is not a \"true\" ivy ( Hedera ), but rather a member of the cashew and pistachio family (Anacardiaceae).\n\nThough T.  radicans is  commonly  eaten  by  many  animals  and  the seeds are consumed by birds, poison ivy is most often thought of as an unwelcome  weed.  It  is  well  known  for  causing  urushiol-induced contact dermatitis, an itchy, irritating, and sometimes painful rash, in most people who touch them. The rash is caused by urushiol, a clear liquid compound in the plant's sap.\n\n\n## Description",

[1] They are commonly characterized by clusters of leaves, each containing three leaflets, [1]   hence  the  common expression \"leaves of three,  let  it  be\". [2]   These  leaves  can  vary  between  an  elliptic  to  egg shape  and  will  have  either  smooth,  lobed,  or  toothed  margins. Additionally,  the  leaf  clusters  are  alternate  on  the  stem.  Clusters  of small,  greenish  flowers  bloom  from  May  to  July  and  produce  white berries in the fall a few millimeters in diameter.

Around 15 to 25 percent of people have no allergic reaction to urushiol, but most people have a  greater  reaction  with  repeated  or  more  concentrated exposure. [7][8]\n\nOver 350,000 people are affected by urushiol annually in the United States. [9]\n\nThe  oozing  fluids  released  by  scratching  blisters  do  not spread the poison.

If this happens, the surfaces should be wiped with bleach or  a  commercial  urushiol  removal  agent.  The blisters and oozing result from blood vessels that develop gaps and leak fluid through the skin; if the skin is cooled, the vessels constrict and leak less.
