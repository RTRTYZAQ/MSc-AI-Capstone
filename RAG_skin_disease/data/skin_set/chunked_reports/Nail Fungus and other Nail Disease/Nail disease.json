        "text": "# Nail disease\n\nA nail disease or onychosis is  a  disease  or  deformity of the nail. Although the nail is a structure produced by the skin and is a skin appendage, nail diseases have a distinct classification as they  have  their  own  signs  and  symptoms  which  may  relate  to other medical conditions. Some nail conditions that show signs of infection or inflammation may require medical assistance.\n\n\n## Diseases\n\n\n- Onychia is an inflammation of the nail folds (surrounding tissue of the nail plate) of the nail with formation of pus and shedding of the nail. Onychia results from the introduction of microscopic pathogens through small wounds.\n\n\n\n## Nail disease or disorder\n\nSpecialty\n\n\n- Onychocryptosis, commonly known as \"ingrown nails\" (unguis incarnatus), can affect either the fingers or the toes. In this condition, the nail cuts into one or both sides of the nail bed, resulting in inflammation and possibly infection. The relative rarity of this condition in the fingers suggests that pressure from the ground or shoe against the toe is a prime factor. The movements involved in walking or other physical disturbances can contribute to the problem. Mild onychocryptosis, particularly in the absence of infection, can be treated by trimming and rounding the nail. More advanced cases, which usually include infection, are treated by surgically excising the\n\n\nOnychia without granuloma Dermatology",

The Vandenbos Procedure is showing high success rates in eliminating onychocryptosis without altering the normal nail.
