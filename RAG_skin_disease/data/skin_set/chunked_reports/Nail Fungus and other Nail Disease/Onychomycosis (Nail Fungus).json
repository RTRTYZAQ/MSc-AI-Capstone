Even if the cheaper KOH test is used first and the PAS test is used only if the KOH test is negative, there is a good chance that the PAS will be done (because of either a true or a false negative with the KOH test). But the terbinafine treatment costs only $10 (plus an additional $43 for liver function tests). In conclusion the authors say that terbinafine has a relatively benign adverse effect profile, with liver damage very rare, so it makes more sense cost-wise for the dermatologist to prescribe the treatment without doing the PAS test. (Another option would be to prescribe the treatment only if the potassium hydroxide test is positive, but it gives a false negative in about 20% of cases of fungal infection.) On the other hand, as of 2015 the price of  topical  (non-oral)  treatment  with  efinaconazole  was  $2307  per  nail,  so  testing  is  recommended  before prescribing it. [21]",

The risk is most  serious  for  people  with  diabetes  and  with  immune  systems  weakened  by  leukemia  or  AIDS,  or medication after organ transplant. Diabetics have vascular and nerve impairment, and are at risk of cellulitis, a potentially serious bacterial infection; any relatively minor injury to feet, including a nail fungal infection, can lead to more serious complications.

        "text": "# Diagnosis\n\nThe diagnosis is generally suspected based on the appearance and confirmed by laboratory testing. [2]  The four main  tests  are  a  potassium  hydroxide  smear,  culture,  histology  examination,  and  polymerase  chain reaction. [2][3]  The sample examined is generally nail scrapings or clippings. [2]  These being from as far up the nail as possible. [3]\n\nNail plate biopsy with periodic acid-Schiff stain appear more  useful than culture or  direct  KOH examination. [15]  To reliably identify nondermatophyte molds, several samples may be necessary. [16]\n\n\n## Classification\n\nThere are five classic types of onychomycosis: [17][18]\n\n\n- Distal subungual onychomycosis is the most common form of tinea unguium [2] and is usually caused by Trichophyton rubrum, which invades the nail bed and the underside of the nail plate.\n- White superficial onychomycosis (WSO) is caused by fungal invasion of the superficial layers of the nail plate to form \"white islands\" on the plate. It accounts for around 10 percent of onychomycosis cases. In some cases, WSO is a misdiagnosis of \"keratins granulations\" which are not a fungus, but a reaction to nail polish that can cause the nails to have a chalky white appearance. A laboratory test should be performed to confirm. [ 19 ]\n- Proximal subungual onychomycosis is fungal penetration of the newly formed nail plate through the proximal nail fold. It is the least common form of tinea unguium in healthy people, but is found more commonly when the patient is immunocompromised. [2]\n- Endonyx onychomycosis is characterized by leukonychia along with a lack of onycholysis or subungual hyperkeratosis. [18]\n- Candidal onychomycosis is Candida species invasion of the fingernails, usually occurring in persons who frequently immerse their hands in water. This normally requires the prior damage of the nail by infection or trauma.\n\n\n\n## Differential diagnosis\n\nIn many cases of suspected nail fungus there is actually no fungal infection, but only nail deformity. [20][21]\n\nTo avoid misdiagnosis as nail psoriasis, lichen planus, contact dermatitis, nail bed tumors such as melanoma, trauma, or yellow nail syndrome, laboratory confirmation may be necessary. [2]\n\nOther  conditions  that  may  appear  similar  to  onychomycosis  include:  psoriasis,  normal  aging,  green  nail syndrome, yellow nail syndrome, and chronic paronychia. [22]\n\n\n## Treatment\n\n\n## Medications\n\nMost treatments are with antifungal medications, either topically or by mouth. [2]  Avoiding use of antifungal therapy by mouth (e.g., terbinafine) in persons without a confirmed infection is recommended, because of the possible  side  effects  of  that  treatment. [20]   First  topical  terbinafine  medication  (MOB-015)  was  launched  in February 2024 in Sweden under the name Terclara. This medication recorded 76% mycological cure rate in two phase 3 studies. The topical property of this medication ensures that typical terbinafine side effects are not present (1000 times lower terbinafine levels in plasma). Terclara (MOB-015)  released  in  Norway  in  February  2025.  Release  in  11 European countries in 2026. Roll-out in other countries will continue in the coming years. [23][24]"

        "text": "Medications  that  may  be  taken  by  mouth  include  terbinafine  (76% effective), itraconazole (60% effective), and fluconazole (48% effective). [2] They share characteristics that enhance their effectiveness:  prompt  penetration  of  the  nail  and  nail  bed, [25]   and persistence in the nail for months after discontinuation of therapy. [26] Ketoconazole  by  mouth  is  not  recommended  due  to  side  effects. [27] Oral terbinafine is better tolerated than itraconazole. [28] For superficial white onychomycosis, systemic rather than topical antifungal therapy is advised. [29]\n\nTopical agents include ciclopirox nail paint, amorolfine, and efinaconazole. [30][31][32]  Some topical treatments need to be applied daily for prolonged periods (at least one year). [31]  Topical amorolfine is applied weekly. [33]\n\nEfinaconazole, a topical azole antifungal, led to cure rates two or three times better than the next-best topical treatment, ciclopirox. [34]  In trials, about 17% of people were cured using efinaconazole, as opposed to 4% of people using placebo. [35]\n\nTopical ciclopirox results in a cure in 6% to 9% of cases. [2][31]  Ciclopirox when used with terbinafine appears to  be  better  than  either  agent  alone. [2]   Although  eficonazole,  P-3051  (ciclopirox  8%  hydrolacquer),  and tavaborole are effective at treating fungal infection of toenails, complete cure rates are low. [36]\n\n\n## Other\n\nChemical (keratolytic) or surgical debridement of the affected nail appears to improve outcomes. [2]\n\nAs of 2014, evidence for laser treatment is unclear as the evidence is of low quality. [37]\n\nTea tree oil is not recommended as a treatment on present data. It was found to irritate the surrounding skin in some trial participants. [38]\n\n\n## Cost\n\n\n## United States\n\nAccording to a 2015 study, the cost in the United States of testing with the periodic acid-Schiff stain (PAS) was about $148. Even if the cheaper KOH test is used first and the PAS test is used only if the KOH test is negative, there is a good chance that the PAS will be done (because of either a true or a false negative with the KOH test). But the terbinafine treatment costs only $10 (plus an additional $43 for liver function tests). In conclusion the authors say that terbinafine has a relatively benign adverse effect profile, with liver damage very rare, so it makes more sense cost-wise for the dermatologist to prescribe the treatment without doing the PAS test. (Another option would be to prescribe the treatment only if the potassium hydroxide test is positive, but it gives a false negative in about 20% of cases of fungal infection.) On the other hand, as of 2015 the price of  topical  (non-oral)  treatment  with  efinaconazole  was  $2307  per  nail,  so  testing  is  recommended  before prescribing it. [21]\n\nThe cost of efinaconazole treatment can be reduced to $65 per 1-month dose using drug coupons, bringing the treatment cost to $715 per nail. [39]"

        "text": "# Canada\n\nIn 2019, a study by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health found the cost for a 48-week efinaconazole course to be $178 for a big toe, and $89 for a different toe. [40]\n\n\n## Prognosis\n\nRecurrence  may  occur  following  treatment,  with  a  20-25%  relapse  rate  within  2  years  of  successful treatment. [13]  Nail fungus can be painful and cause permanent damage to nails. It may lead to other serious infections if  the  immune system is suppressed due to medication, diabetes or other conditions. The risk is most  serious  for  people  with  diabetes  and  with  immune  systems  weakened  by  leukemia  or  AIDS,  or medication after organ transplant. Diabetics have vascular and nerve impairment, and are at risk of cellulitis, a potentially serious bacterial infection; any relatively minor injury to feet, including a nail fungal infection, can lead to more serious complications. [41]  Infection of the bone is another rare complication. [7]\n\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nA 2003 survey of diseases of the foot in 16 European countries found onychomycosis to be the most frequent fungal foot infection and estimated its prevalence at 27%. [42][43]  Prevalence was observed to increase with age. In Canada, the prevalence was estimated to be 6.48%. [44]  Onychomycosis affects approximately one-third of diabetics [45]  and is 56% more frequent in people with psoriasis. [46]\n\n\n## Etymology\n\nThe  term  is  from  Ancient  Greek ὄ νυξ onyx \"nail\",  μύκης mykēs \"fungus\", [47]   and  the  suffix  -ωσις ōsis \"functional disease\".\n\n\n## Research\n\nResearch  suggests  that  fungi  are  sensitive  to  heat,  typically  40-60  °C  (104-140  °F).  The  basis  of  laser treatment is to try to heat the nail bed to these temperatures in order to disrupt fungal growth. [48]  As of 2013 research  into  laser  treatment  seemed  promising. [2]   There  is  also  ongoing  development  in  photodynamic therapy, which uses laser or LED light to activate photosensitisers that eradicate fungi. [49]"
