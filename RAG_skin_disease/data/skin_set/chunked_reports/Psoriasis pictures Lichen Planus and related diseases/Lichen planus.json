[1][2]  It is not an actual lichen, but is named for  its  appearance. [3]   It  is  characterized  by  polygonal,  flattopped, violaceous papules and plaques with overlying, reticulated,  fine  white  scale  (Wickham's  striae),  commonly affecting  dorsal  hands,  flexural  wrists  and  forearms,  trunk, anterior  lower  legs  and  oral  mucosa.

There  is  no  cure,  but  many  different medications and procedures have been used in efforts to control the symptoms.\n\nThe term lichenoid reaction (lichenoid eruption or lichenoid lesion) refers to a lesion of similar or identical histopathologic and clinical appearance to lichen planus (i.e., an area which resembles lichen planus, both to the naked eye and under a microscope).

Atrophic CLP is the clinical endpoint of chronic annular or hypertrophic LP with atrophic lesions. The use of potent topical corticosteroids for a long-term may predispose the patient to developing atrophic lesions.

[1][2]  It is not an actual lichen, but is named for  its  appearance. [3]   It  is  characterized  by  polygonal,  flattopped, violaceous papules and plaques with overlying, reticulated,  fine  white  scale  (Wickham's  striae),  commonly affecting  dorsal  hands,  flexural  wrists  and  forearms,  trunk, anterior  lower  legs  and  oral  mucosa.

[5]  Although there is a broad clinical range of LP manifestations, the skin and oral cavity remain as the major sites of involvement. [6]  The cause is unknown, but it is thought to be the result  of  an  autoimmune  process  with  an  unknown  initial  trigger.  There  is  no  cure,  but  many  different medications and procedures have been used in efforts to control the symptoms.\n\nThe term lichenoid reaction (lichenoid eruption or lichenoid lesion) refers to a lesion of similar or identical histopathologic and clinical appearance to lichen planus (i.e., an area which resembles lichen planus, both to the naked eye and under a microscope). [7][8]  Sometimes dental materials or certain medications can cause lichenoid reactions. [7]  They can also occur in association with graft versus host disease. [7][9]:  258\n\n\n## Classification\n\nLichen planus lesions are so called because of their \"lichen-like\" appearance [3]  and can be classified by the site they involve, or by their morphology.\n\n\n## Site\n\nLichen planus may be categorized as affecting mucosal or cutaneous surfaces.\n\n\n- Cutaneous forms are those affecting the skin, scalp, and nails. [ 10 ][ 11 ][ 12 ]\n- Mucosal forms are those affecting the lining of the gastrointestinal tract (mouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, anus), larynx, and other mucosal surfaces including the genitals, peritoneum, ears, nose, bladder and conjunctiva of the eyes. [ 13 ][ 14 ][ 15 ]\n\n\n\n## Pattern\n\nLichen planus lesions can occur in many different forms or morphologies: [16]\n\n\n## Papular\n\nPapular form is the classic cutaneous lichen planus (CLP) lesion characterized by shiny, red or purple-colored, flat-topped papule. Lesions may have a thin, transparent, and adherent scale. Fine whitish points or lacy lines (Wickham's striae) may be seen on the surface of well-developed papules. [2]\n\n\n## Annular\n\n'Ring-shaped' lesions that develop gradually from single small pigmented spots into circular groups of papules with clear, unaffected skin in the center. The ring-like lesions may very slowly enlarge, co-join and morph into larger irregular (serpentine) bands, sometimes accompanied by lines (See Linear, below). Annular CLP is uncommon and classically involves the male genitalia (glans penis and penile shaft), groin, axilla and also the extremities. [2]"

        "text": "# Linear\n\nPapules are arranged in a line (the \"Blaschko line\"). [17]  This pattern may develop secondary to trauma (koebnerization) or, uncommonly, as a spontaneous, isolated eruption, usually on the extremities, and rarely on the face. [18]\n\n\n## Hypertrophic\n\nThis pattern is characterized by hyperkeratotic thick pruritic red-brown to purple-gray plaques with follicular accentuation. Hypertrophic CLP commonly involves the extremities, especially the interphalangeal joints and the anterior legs in a symmetrical distribution. [2]  This form is also known as \"lichen planus verrucosus\".\n\n\n## Atrophic\n\nThis morphology is characterized by the presence of a few well-demarcated, white-bluish papules or plaques with central superficial atrophy. Atrophic CLP is the clinical endpoint of chronic annular or hypertrophic LP with atrophic lesions. The use of potent topical corticosteroids for a long-term may predispose the patient to developing atrophic lesions. [2]\n\n\n## Bullous\n\nThis morphology is characterized by the development of vesicles and bullae with the skin lesions. This is a rare variant of lichen planus, and also known as \"vesiculobullous lichen planus\".\n\n\n## Actinic\n\nRare form presenting as nummular patches or plaques with a hypopigmented halo surrounding a hyperpigmented center. Actinic CLP is more prevalent in African Americans, Indians, and MiddleEastern individuals and commonly affects the sun-exposed areas. [2]\n\n\n## Ulcerative\n\nThis morphology is characterized by chronic, painful bullae and ulceration of the feet, often with cicatricial sequelae evident. This is a rare variant of lichen planus.\n\n\n## Pigmented\n\nThis morphology is characterized by hyperpigmented, dark-brown macules in sun-exposed areas and flexural folds. This is a rare variant of lichen planus.\n\n\n## Follicular\n\nCharacterized by follicular, flat, elevated or hemispherical erythematous papules with or without keratoses presenting in groups or disseminated. The Graham-Little-Piccardi-Lasseur syndrome, seen in a familial pattern and also predominantly in women, is characterized by the appearance of follicular LP on the trunk with LP follicularis decalvans on the scalp. Follicular LP on the scalp is more likely to lead to scarring alopecia. [16]\n\n\n## Inverse\n\nCharacterized by extensive erythematous lesions with poorly defined borders and in part with lichenification. Inverse LP typically affects the axillae, inguinal creases, limb flexures and submammary region. Pigmentation of the individual lesions at these inverse locations are typical. Additionally, keratotic papules and erosions with a bizarre configuration can occur. [16]\n\n\n## Overlap syndromes\n\n\nOccasionally, lichen planus is known to occur with other conditions. For example:\n- Lupus erythematosus overlap syndrome. Lesions of this syndrome share features of both lupus erythematosus and lichen planus. Lesions are usually large and hypopigmented, atrophic, and with a red to blue colour and minimal scaling. Telangectasia may be present. [19][20]\n- Lichen sclerosus overlap syndrome, sharing features of lichen planus and lichen sclerosus. [21]"

This description is known as the characteristic \"6 Ps\" of lichen planus: planar (flat-topped), purple, polygonal, pruritic, papules, and plaques. [10]  This rash, after regressing, is likely to leave an area of hyperpigmentation that slowly fades. That said, a variety of other lesions can also occur. [3]\n\n\n## Skin\n\n\nVariants of cutaneous lichen planus are distinguished based upon the appearance  of  the  lesions  and/or  their  distribution. [22]   Lesions  can affect the:\n- Extremities (face, dorsal hands, arms, and nape of neck). [a]  This is more common in Middle Eastern countries in spring and summer, where sunlight appears to have a precipitating effect. [ 18 ][ 23 ][ 24 ]\n- Palms and soles\n- Intertriginous areas of the skin. This is also known as \"inverse lichen planus\". [18]\n- Nails [25]  characterized by irregular longitudinal grooving and ridging of the nail plate, thinning of the nail plate, pterygium formation, shedding of the nail plate with atrophy of the nail bed, subungual keratosis, longitudinal erthronychia (red streaks), and subungual hyperpigmentation. [26]  A sandpapered appearance is present in around 10% of individuals with nail lichen planus. [25]\n- Hair and scalp. The scalp is rarely affected by a condition known as lichen planopilaris, acuminatus, follicular lichen planus, and peripilaris, characterised by violaceous, adherent follicular scale with progressive scarring alopecia. While lichen planus and lichen planopilaris may occur together, aside from sharing the term 'lichen' and revealing inflammation on skin biopsy, there is neither established data on their co-occurrence nor data to suggest a common etiology. Lichen planopilaris is considered an orphan disease with no definitive prevalence data and no proven effective treatments.

This can present with difficulty or pain when swallowing due to oesophageal inflammation, or as the development of an esophageal stricture. It has also been hypothesized that it is a precursor to squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. [14][35]\n- Genital lichen planus, which may cause lesions on the glans penis or skin of the scrotum in males, and the vulva or vagina in females. [10]  Symptoms may include lower urinary tract symptoms associated with stenosis of the urethra, painful sexual intercourse, and itching. [10]  In females, Vulvovaginal-gingival syndrome, is severe and distinct variant affecting the vulva, vagina, and gums, with complications including scarring, vaginal stricture formation, [36]  or vulva destruction. [37]  The corresponding syndrome in males, affecting the glans penis and gums, is the peno-gingival syndrome. [18]  It is associated with HLA-DQB1. [18][38]\n\n\n\n## Mouth\n\nOral lichen planus (also termed oral mucosal lichen planus ), is a form of  mucosal  lichen  planus,  where  lichen  planus  involves  the  oral mucosa, the lining of the mouth. [39]  This may occur in combination with other variants of lichen planus. Six clinical forms of oral lichen planus (OLP) are recognized: [40]\n\n\n## Reticular\n\nThe most common presentation of oral lichen planus (OLP) is characterised by the net-like or spider web-like appearance of lacy white lines, known as Wickham's striae. [41]  This is usually asymptomatic. Reticular OLP may progress to the more severe subtypes, such as the erosive form, if left untreated. [2]\n\n\n## Erosive or ulcerative\n\nThe second most common form and the most advanced form of oral lichen planus, [41][2]  is characterised by oral ulcers presenting with persistent, irregular areas of redness, ulcerations and erosions covered with a yellow slough. This can occur in one or more areas of the mouth. In 25% of people with erosive oral lichen planus, the gums are involved, described as desquamative gingivitis (a condition not unique to lichen planus). This may be the initial or only sign of the condition. [42] Involvement of the dorsum of the tongue might cause an altered sense of taste (dysgeusia). [2]"

        "text": "# Papular\n\nThis form is characterized by small white pinpoint papules that are asymptomatic. Hence, they can be easily missed during a routine checkup. It is referred to as the initial and transient phase of OLP. [2]\n\n\n## Plaque-like\n\nLarge, homogenous white patches are characteristic of this form which may resemble leukoplakia. This form is more prevalent in tobacco smokers. [2]\n\n\n## Atrophic\n\nThis form is a common presentation that has similarities to the erosive form. It has a more prominent atrophic lesion on a background of erythema with radiating white striae at the margins. [2]  Atrophic oral lichen planus may also manifest as desquamative gingivitis. [42]\n\n\n## Bullous\n\nRare form of OLP characterized by fluid-filled vesicles ranging in size from 1 to 2 mm to several cm in diameter. The vesicles or bullae appear white or gray-purple in color and are fluctuant. The fluid in the vesicles are usually clear but may be hemorrhagic or purulent upon secondary infection. These rupture easily and they leave an ulcerated, painful surface.\n\nThese  types  often  coexist  in  the  same  individual.  Oral  lichen  planus  (OLP)  tends  to  present  bilaterally  as mostly white lesions on the inner cheek, [41]  although any mucosal site in the mouth may be involved. Other sites, in decreasing order of frequency, may include the tongue, lips, gingivae, floor of the mouth, and very rarely, the palate. [41]\n\nThe most common symptoms of OLP include pain, burning, and discomfort in affected areas of the mouth. In severe  cases,  OLP  is  associated  with  debilitating  pain  causing  difficulty  speaking,  eating,  and  swallowing, which  may  result  in  malnutrition  and  weight  loss,  or  compromising  airways  and  leading  to  breathing difficulties.  In  addition  to  physical  discomfort,  OLP  can  cause  anxiety,  depression,  social  isolation,  and compromised quality of life, impacting patients' ability to work and participate in social life. Generally, OLP tends not to cause any discomfort or pain in mild cases, although many people experience significant soreness when eating or drinking acidic or spicy foodstuffs or beverages.\n\nOral lichen planus represents a serious chronic condition with significant unmet medical need. The FDA has recognized  OLP  as  a  serious  disease  warranting  expanded  access  programs  for  investigational  treatments, acknowledging the substantial impact on patients' daily functioning and quality of life. [42]  When symptoms arise,  they  are  most  commonly  associated  with  the  atrophic  and  ulcerative  subtypes.  These  symptoms  can include a burning sensation to severe pain. [41]  They may also experience mucosal bleeding in response to mild trauma, such as toothbrushing. Additionally, the Koebner phenomenon (the development of new lesions at sites of trauma) is not only present in cutaneous lichen planus (CLP) but can also occur in the setting of OLP.\n\nSevere  manifestations  of  OLP  include:  ·  Pain  that  interferes  with  basic  oral  functions  including  speaking, eating, and swallowing · Malnutrition and weight loss due to difficulty eating · Respiratory compromise when lesions  affect  airway  passages  ·  Psychological  impact  including  anxiety,  depression,  and  social  isolation  · Impaired work performance and reduced ability to participate in social activities · Oral hygiene deficits due to pain  during  tooth  brushing  or  denture  wear  The  disease  affects  approximately  6  million  Americans  with currently  no  FDA-approved  therapies  available,  highlighting  the  substantial  unmet  medical  need  in  this patient population.\n\nResidual  postinflammatory  hyperpigmentation  has  been  reported  in  association  with  OLP,  manifesting  as brown to black pigmentation on the oral mucosa and may most likely occur in dark-skinned individuals. [43]\n\nOLP may occur as a sole manifestation of the disease or in conjunction with other clinical manifestations of LP, including cutaneous LP, genital LP, nail LP, and lichen planopilaris (scalp LP).

        "text": "# Causes\n\nCutaneous  LP  is  a  self-limiting  condition.  It  usually  resolves  within  6  to  12  months.  Oral  LP  is  a  non infectious, chronic inflammatory condition that involves the oral mucosa and may be accompanied by skin lesions. The etiology of oral LP are unknown.\n\nIt is not clear whether the mechanisms causing isolated oral LP are different from those causing oral LP with cutaneous  LP.  An  immune-mediated  mechanism  where  basal  keratinocytes  are  being  targeted  as  foreign antigens  by  activated  T  cells,  especially  CD8+  T  cells,  has  been  proposed. [44]   Upregulation  of  intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and cytokines associated with T-helper 1 immune response, may also play an important role in the pathogenesis of lichen planus.\n\nStress  is  thought  to  play  a  role  in  the  pathogenesis  of  oral  LP.  Patients  with  anxiety  and  depression  are reported more commonly with oral LP if compared to normal healthy individuals. [45][46]  Some studies have indicated that stressful events can induce LP lesions in otherwise healthy individuals. However, a cause effect relationship between stress and the onset of oral LP has not been demonstrated.\n\nAutoimmune  response  to  epithelial  self-antigens  remains  a  possibility.  A  single  study  of  cutaneous  LP reported evidence in support of autoimmunity by expanding in vitro T cells isolated from the skin lesions of two patients, followed by testing the ability of these T cells to kill autologous keratinocytes (cytotoxicity).\n\nSeveral potential triggers of oral LP have been proposed over the years, mainly\n\n\n- Hypersensitivity reaction\n- Restorative material (e.g. amalgam [ 47 ] and composite) or drugs can cause hypersensitivity reaction and lead to oral LP.\n- Oral LP usually resolve upon removal of the trigger, as is characteristics of oral LP\n- Viral infection\n\n\n\n## Pathogenesis\n\nOral LP is considered to be a T-cell mediated chronic inflammatory tissue reaction that results in a cytotoxic reaction  against  epithelial  basal  cells. [48]   The  inflammatory  infiltrate  in  oral  LP  is  primarily  composed  of CD8+ T cells. A potential pathway for CD8+ T cell-mediated cytotoxicity in oral LP is described as follows: [48]\n\nAntigens  presented  on  MHC  1  molecules  activates  CD8+  T  cells  on  keratinocytes  or  by  encounters  with activated CD4+ helper T cells or cytokines produced by activated CD4+ helper T cells\n\nActivated CD8+ T cells induce keratinocyte apoptosis through various mechanisms such as secretion of tumor necrosis  factor  (TNF)-alpha,  secretion  of  granzyme  B,  or  Fas-Fas  ligand  interactions.  Chemokines  are produced by activated CD8+ T cells that attract additional inflammatory cells, thereby promoting continued inflammation.\n\n\nOther mechanisms that have been proposed include:\n- upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases that disrupt the epithelial basement membrane zone and allow entry of immune cells into the epidermis,\n- the release of proinflammatory mediators and proteases by mast cells, and\n- perturbations in the innate immune response that may involve toll-like receptors. [ 48 ][ 49 ][ 50 ][ 51 ]\n\n\nOral  LP  may  also  be  caused  by  genetic  factor  which  influence  the  immune  function.  A  separate  study performed in China [52]  found an association between a polymorphism in the TNF-alpha gene and risk for oral LP in a subset of patients. An Italian study found a significant increase in a genetic polymorphism of the first"

[52]\n\n\n## Diagnosis\n\n\n## Skin\n\nPatient history and clinical presentation need to be taken to diagnose lichen planus. Patients with suspected cutaneous lichen planus need to be evaluated clinically through patient interviews and physical examinations. Patients  should  be  questioned  about  their  medication  history,  any  history  of  pruritus  or  genital  pain  and history of dysphagia or odynophagia. Examination of entire cutaneous surface including the scalp, oral cavity and  external  genitalia  need  to  be  included.  Wickham's  striae  often  can  be  seen  during  microscopic examination of cutaneous lesions of lichen planus. [53][54]\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis of cutaneous lichen planus, a skin biopsy can be done. A punch biopsy of sufficient depth  to  the  mid  dermis  is  usually  significant.  Immunofluorescence  studies  are  not  always  needed.  Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) can be useful in patients with bullous lesions to differentiate the condition from an autoimmune vesiculobullous disease. [55]\n\n\n## Mouth\n\nA  diagnosis  of  oral  lichen  planus  (LP)  is  confirmed  through  review  of  the  patient  history,  physical examination, and histologic findings.\n\n\nThe clinical evaluation should include a patient history that assesses the following:\n- History of LP involving other body sites or other skin disorders that may present with similar findings (e.g., autoimmune blistering diseases)\n- Presence of associated symptoms (e.g., pain, burning)\n- Medication the patients are taking within the few weeks to months after drug initiation e.g. antihypertensives, antidepressants, diuretics, antidiabetics, NSAIDs, etc. to evaluate for the possibility of an oral lichenoid drug eruption\n- History of dental restorations, [47]  use of dental appliances, or oral exposure to substances that may cause oral lichenoid contact eruptions (e.g. dental composites, cobalt chromium based dentures etc.)\n\n\nA full examination that includes the evaluation of the mucosal and cutaneous surfaces, including the vulva, vagina,  penis,  scalp,  and  nails  should  be  performed.  Thorough  examination  may  lead  to  the  detection  of extraoral manifestations of LP that provide additional support for the diagnosis or the identification of clinical findings that suggest another diagnosis.\n\nTissue biopsies of oral LP help to confirm the diagnosis and are particularly of value for erythematous and erosive LP, which share features with multiple other mucosal disorders, including oral malignancy. Biopsies to confirm oral LP are less essential in patients who present with classic reticular LP, particularly in patients in whom a diagnosis  of  LP  has  already  been  confirmed  through  biopsy  of  an  extraoral  manifestation  of  this disorder.

Histologic findings of a deep mixed infiltrate with lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils (with or without eosinophils) and perivascular inflammation favor this diagnosis.\n\n\n## Oral lichenoid contact reaction (allergic contact mucositis)\n\nOral lichenoid contact reactions may be caused by a variety of substances. The clinical and histologic features of oral lichenoid contact reactions are similar to oral LP. Patch testing and recognition of the proximity of an offending substance to the eruption can aid with diagnosis. [37]\n\n\n## Autoimmune blistering diseases\n\nMucous membrane pemphigoid and other autoimmune blistering diseases may present with oral erosions and desquamative gingivitis  similar  to  that  seen  in  erosive  LP.  Biopsies  for  routine  histologic  examination  and direct immunofluorescence are useful for distinguishing these disorders from oral LP.\n\n\n## Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)\n\nLacy, reticulated plaques or erosions that resemble oral LP may occur in GVHD.

White patches  or  plaques  usually  appear  on  the  oral  mucosa.  To  rule  out malignancy, a biopsy of leukoplakia is indicated.

The  highest  risk  for  oral SCC  may  occur in patients with erythematous or erosive oral LP. [60][61][62]  A biopsy is indicated.\n\n\n## Leukoedema\n\nLeukoedema is a common, benign finding in the oral cavity that presents as white-gray, somewhat translucent plaques on the mucosa.

Patients present with white plaques or erythematous patches on the buccal mucosa, palate, tongue, or oropharynx that may be mistaken for reticular LP. [65]\n\n\n## Histopathology\n\nThe  histologic  findings  of  oral  LP  can  offer  strong  support  for  the diagnosis, but are not pathognomonic. Clinical correlation is required. Common histologic findings of oral LP include: [47]\n\n\n- Parakeratosis and slight acanthosis of the epithelium\n- Saw-toothed rete ridges\n- Liquefaction (hydropic) degeneration of the basal layer with apoptotic keratinocytes (referred to as Civatte, colloid, hyaline, or cytoid bodies)\n- An amorphous band of eosinophilic material at the basement membrane composed of fibrin or fibrinogen.\n- A lichenoid (band-like) lymphocytic infiltrate immediately subjacent to the epithelium.\n\n\nNonetheless, interpreting the histopathological features of oral LP has been associated historically with high intra-observer and inter-observer variabilities. [66]\n\n\n## Treatment\n\nThere is no cure for lichen planus, [41]  and so treatment of cutaneous and oral lichen planus is for symptomatic relief or due to cosmetic concerns. [3][41][67]  When medical treatment is pursued, first-line treatment typically involves either topical or systemic corticosteroids, [3]  and removal of any triggers. [68]  Without treatment, most lesions  will  spontaneously  resolve  within  6-9  months  for  cutaneous  lesions, [3]   and  longer  for  mucosal lesions. [69]\n\n\n## Skin\n\nMany different treatments have been reported for cutaneous lichen planus, however there is a general lack of evidence  of  efficacy  for  any  treatment. [70][71]   The  mainstay  of  localized  skin  lesions  is  topical  steroids. [41] Additional treatments include retinoids, such as acitretin, or sulfasalazine. Narrow band UVB phototherapy or systemic PUVA therapy are known treatment modalities for generalized disease. [44]\n\n\n## Mouth\n\nReassurance that the condition is benign, elimination of precipitating factors and improving oral hygiene are considered  initial  management  for  symptomatic  OLP,  and  these  measures  are  reported  to  be  useful. [41] Treatment usually involves topical corticosteroids (such as betamethasone, clobetasol, dexamethasone, and triamcinolone)  and  analgesics,  or  if  these  are  ineffective  and  the  condition  is  severe,  then  systemic corticosteroids  may  be  used.  Calcineurin  inhibitors  (such  as  pimecrolimus,  tacrolimus  or  cyclosporin)  are sometimes  used. [41]   While  topical  steroids  are  widely  accepted  as  first  line  treatment  for  mucosal  lichen planus, there is only weak evidence to support their effectiveness for erosive oral lichen planus. [72]\n\nCurrently, there are no FDA-approved therapies specifically for OLP, representing a significant unmet medical need. Available treatments are palliative rather than curative and often provide inadequate symptom control.

The  FDA's  approval of expanded  access  programs  for investigational OLP treatments underscores the regulatory recognition of this condition as a serious disease with substantial unmet therapeutic need.\n\n\n# Prognosis\n\nCutaneous lichen planus lesions typically resolve within six months to a year. However, some variant such as the hypertrophic variant might persist for years if left untreated or unmonitored. [2]\n\nIt is found that cutaneous lichen planus does not carry a risk of skin cancer. [73]  In contrast to cutaneous LP, which is self limited, lichen planus lesions in the mouth may persist for many years, [67]  and tend to be difficult to treat, with relapses being common. [38][2]\n\nAlthough this condition was first described almost a century ago, it has been reported that its associated oral cancer risk has been exaggerated. [74]  Overall, it is found that patients with erythematous or erosive oral lichen planus  have  a  higher  risk  of  oral  squamous  cell  carcinoma  compared  to  patients  diagnosed  with  other variants. [75]\n\nDue  to  the  possibility  that  oral  LP  may  increase  risk  for  oral  cancer,  patients  with  oral  lichen  planus  are encouraged  to  avoid  activities  known  to  increase  the  risk  for  oral  cancer,  such  as  smoking  and  alcohol use. [75][73]   OLP carries a significant risk of malignant transformation to oral squamous cell carcinoma. The chronic inflammatory nature of OLP creates an environment that may predispose to dysplastic changes and eventual  malignant  transformation.  Studies  demonstrate  that  patients  with  erythematous  or  erosive  oral lichen planus have a markedly higher risk of developing oral squamous cell carcinoma compared to patients with other variants or the general population.\n\nCancer surveillance  is  critical  as  dysplastic  lesions  may  be  inadvertently  diagnosed  as  \"lichenoid  mucositis with  mild  reactive  epithelial  atypia\"  when  they  may  actually  represent  dysplasia  with  malignant  potential. Patients with oral lichen planus should be followed-up at least every 6 to 12 months, to assess the disease activity, changes in symptoms or even detect early signs of malignancy. [75]\n\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nThe  overall  estimated  prevalence  of  lichen  planus  in  worldwide  population  is  in  the  range  of  0.2%  to 5%. [10][76][77][78][79][80]\n\nIt generally occurs more commonly in females, in a ratio of 3:2, and most cases are diagnosed between the ages of 30 and 60, but it can occur at any age. [10][81][46]\n\nLichen  planus  can  occur  in  patients  as  diverse  cutaneous  manifestations  alone  or  in  combination  with mucosal lichen planus and, or lichen planus of the nails. Study shows that frequency of mucosal involvement of lichen planus patients is 30- 70%. [16]\n\nOral lichen planus is relatively common, [38]  It is one of the most common mucosal diseases. The prevalence in the general population is about 1.27-2.0%, with an estimated 6-7 million people affected in the United States alone. [41][67]  The disease predominantly affects middle-aged individuals (30-60 years) with a female-to-male ratio  of  2:1. [41]   Oral  lichen  planus  in  children  is  rare.  About  50%  of  females  with  oral  lichen  planus  were reported to have undiagnosed vulvar lichen planus. [10]\n\nThe substantial patient population combined with the lack of effective treatments creates a major healthcare burden and highlights the critical need for novel therapeutic approaches. Healthcare utilization is significant due to: · Chronic, relapsing nature requiring long-term management · Need for regular cancer surveillance given malignant transformation risk · Treatment-related complications requiring additional interventions · Quality of life impairment affecting work productivity and social functioning"
