[1]  Typically it results in a red, itchy, scaly, circular rash. [1]  Hair loss may occur in the area affected. [1] Symptoms  begin  four  to  fourteen  days  after  exposure. [1]   The types of dermatophytoses are typically named for the area of the body that they affect. [2]  Multiple areas can be affected at a given time. [4]\n\nAbout  40  types  of  fungus  can  cause  dermatophytosis. [2]   They are typically of the Trichophyton , Microsporum , or Epidermophyton type. [2] Risk factors include using  public showers,  contact  sports  such  as  wrestling,  excessive  sweating, contact with animals, obesity, and poor immune function. [3][4] Ringworm can spread from other animals or between people. [3] Diagnosis is often based on the appearance and symptoms.

Hairy areas of skin were considered too difficult to treat, so the scalp was treated with X-rays and followed up with antifungal medication. [23]  Another treatment from around the same time was application of araroba powder. [24]\n\n\n## Terminology\n\nThe most common term for the infection, \"ringworm\", is a misnomer, since the condition is caused by fungi of several different species and not by parasitic worms.\n\n\n## Other animals\n\nRingworm caused by Trichophyton verrucosum is  a  frequent clinical condition in cattle. Young animals are more frequently affected. The lesions are located on the head, neck, tail, and perineum. [25]  The typical lesion is a round, whitish crust. Multiple lesions may coalesce in \"map-like\" appearance.",

[26]\n\nDermatophytosis may also be present in the holotype of the Cretaceous eutriconodont mammal Spinolestes , suggesting a Mesozoic origin for this disease.\n\n\n## Diagnosis\n\nRingworm in pets may often be asymptomatic, resulting in a carrier condition which infects other pets. In some cases, the disease only appears when the animal develops an immunodeficiency condition. Circular bare patches on the skin suggest the diagnosis, but no lesion is truly specific to the fungus. Similar patches may result from  allergies, sarcoptic mange,  and  other  conditions.  Three  species of  fungi  cause  95%  of dermatophytosis in pets: these are Microsporum  canis , Microsporum  gypseum , and Trichophyton mentagrophytes .\n\nVeterinarians have several tests to identify ringworm infection and identify the fungal species that cause it:",

M. canis ,  despite its name, occurs more commonly in domestic cats, and 98% of cat infections are with this organism. It can also infect dogs and humans, however. T. mentagrophytes has a major reservoir in rodents, but can also infect pet rabbits, dogs, and horses. M. gypseum is a soil organism and is often contracted from gardens and other such places. Besides humans, it may infect rodents, dogs, cats, horses, cattle, and swine. [27]\n\n\n# Treatment\n\n\n## Pet animals\n\nTreatment requires both systemic oral treatment with most of the same drugs used in humans-terbinafine, fluconazole, or itraconazole-as well as a topical \"dip\" therapy. [28]\n\nBecause  of  the  usually  longer  hair  shafts  in  pets  compared  to  those  of  humans,  the  area  of  infection  and possibly all of the longer hair of the pet must be clipped to decrease the load of fungal spores clinging to the pet's hair shafts.

[22]\n\nMisdiagnosis  and  treatment  of  ringworm  with  a  topical  steroid,  a  standard  treatment  of  the  superficially similar  pityriasis  rosea,  can  result  in  tinea  incognito,  a  condition  where  ringworm  fungus  grows  without typical features, such as a distinctive raised border.\n\n\n## History\n\nDermatophytosis has been prevalent since before 1906, at which time ringworm was treated with compounds of  mercury or sometimes sulfur or iodine. Hairy areas of skin were considered too difficult to treat, so the scalp was treated with X-rays and followed up with antifungal medication. [23]  Another treatment from around the same time was application of araroba powder. [24]\n\n\n## Terminology\n\nThe most common term for the infection, \"ringworm\", is a misnomer, since the condition is caused by fungi of several different species and not by parasitic worms.\n\n\n## Other animals\n\nRingworm caused by Trichophyton verrucosum is  a  frequent clinical condition in cattle. Young animals are more frequently affected. The lesions are located on the head, neck, tail, and perineum. [25]  The typical lesion is a round, whitish crust. Multiple lesions may coalesce in \"map-like\" appearance."

        "text": "On neck and withers\n\nOn perineum\n\nClinical  dermatophytosis  is  also  diagnosed  in  sheep,  dogs,  cats,  and  horses.  Causative  agents,  besides Trichophyton verrucosum, are T.  mentagrophytes , T.  equinum , Microsporum gypseum , M. canis ,  and M. nanum . [26]\n\nDermatophytosis may also be present in the holotype of the Cretaceous eutriconodont mammal Spinolestes , suggesting a Mesozoic origin for this disease.\n\n\n## Diagnosis\n\nRingworm in pets may often be asymptomatic, resulting in a carrier condition which infects other pets. In some cases, the disease only appears when the animal develops an immunodeficiency condition. Circular bare patches on the skin suggest the diagnosis, but no lesion is truly specific to the fungus. Similar patches may result from  allergies, sarcoptic mange,  and  other  conditions.  Three  species of  fungi  cause  95%  of dermatophytosis in pets: these are Microsporum  canis , Microsporum  gypseum , and Trichophyton mentagrophytes .\n\nVeterinarians have several tests to identify ringworm infection and identify the fungal species that cause it:\n\nWoods test: This is an ultraviolet light with a magnifying lens. Only 50% of M. canis will show up as an applegreen fluorescence on hair shafts, under the UV light. The other fungi do not show. The fluorescent material is not the fungus itself (which does not fluoresce), but rather an excretory product of the fungus which sticks to hairs. Infected skin does not fluoresce.\n\nMicroscopic test: The veterinarian takes hairs from around the infected area and places them in a staining solution to view under the microscope. Fungal spores may be viewed directly on hair shafts. This technique identifies  a  fungal  infection  in  about  40%-70%  of  the  infections,  but  cannot  identify  the  species  of dermatophyte.\n\nCulture test: This is the most effective, but also the most time-consuming, way to determine if ringworm is on a pet. In this test, the veterinarian collects hairs from the pet, or else collects fungal spores from the pet's hair with  a  toothbrush,  or  other  instrument,  and  inoculates  fungal  media  for  culture.  These  cultures  can  be brushed  with  transparent  tape  and  then  read  by  the  veterinarian  using  a  microscope,  or  can  be  sent  to  a pathological lab. The three common types of fungi which commonly cause pet ringworm can be identified by their  characteristic  spores.  These  are  different-appearing  macroconidia  in  the  two  common  species  of Microspora , and typical microconidia in Trichophyton infections. [26]"

        "text": "Identifying the species of fungi involved in pet infections can be helpful in controlling the source of infection. M. canis ,  despite its name, occurs more commonly in domestic cats, and 98% of cat infections are with this organism. It can also infect dogs and humans, however. T. mentagrophytes has a major reservoir in rodents, but can also infect pet rabbits, dogs, and horses. M. gypseum is a soil organism and is often contracted from gardens and other such places. Besides humans, it may infect rodents, dogs, cats, horses, cattle, and swine. [27]\n\n\n# Treatment\n\n\n## Pet animals\n\nTreatment requires both systemic oral treatment with most of the same drugs used in humans-terbinafine, fluconazole, or itraconazole-as well as a topical \"dip\" therapy. [28]\n\nBecause  of  the  usually  longer  hair  shafts  in  pets  compared  to  those  of  humans,  the  area  of  infection  and possibly all of the longer hair of the pet must be clipped to decrease the load of fungal spores clinging to the pet's hair shafts. However, close shaving is usually not done because nicking the skin facilitates further skin infection.\n\nTwice-weekly bathing of the pet with diluted lime sulfur dip solution is effective in eradicating fungal spores. This must continue for 3 to 8 weeks. [29]\n\nWashing of household hard surfaces with 1:10 household sodium hypochlorite bleach solution is effective in killing spores, but it is too irritating to be used directly on hair and skin.\n\nPet  hair  must  be  rigorously  removed  from  all  household  surfaces,  and  then  the  vacuum  cleaner  bag,  and perhaps even the vacuum cleaner itself, discarded when this has been done repeatedly. Removal of all hair is important, since spores may survive 12 months or even as long as two years on hair clinging to surfaces. [30]\n\n\n## Cattle\n\nIn  bovines,  an  infestation  is  difficult  to  cure,  as  systemic  treatment  is  uneconomical.  Local  treatment  with iodine compounds is time-consuming, as it needs scraping of crusty lesions. Moreover, it must be carefully conducted using gloves, lest the worker become infested.\n\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nWorldwide, superficial fungal infections caused by dermatophytes are estimated to infect around 20-25% of the population  and  it is  thought  that  dermatophytes  infect  10-15%  of  the  population  during  their lifetime. [31][32]   The  highest  incidence  of  superficial  mycoses  result  from  dermatophytoses  which  are  most prevalent in tropical regions. [31][33]  Onychomycosis, a common infection caused by dermatophytes, is found with  varying  prevalence  rates  in  many  countries. [34] Tinea  pedis +  onychomycosis, Tinea  corporis , Tinea capitis are  the  most  common  dermatophytosis  found  in  humans  across  the  world. [34] Tinea  capitis has  a greater prevalence in children. [31]  The increasing prevalence of dermatophytes resulting in Tinea capitis has been  causing  epidemics  throughout  Europe  and  America. [34]   In  pets,  cats  are  the  most  affected  by dermatophytosis. [35]   Pets  are  susceptible  to  dermatophytoses  caused  by Microsporum canis , Microsporum gypseum , and Trichophyton . [35]  For dermatophytosis in animals, risk factors depend on age, species, breed, underlying conditions, stress, grooming, and injuries. [35]"

        "text": "Numerous studies have found Tinea capitis to be the most prevalent dermatophyte to infect children across the  continent  of  Africa. [32]   Dermatophytosis  has  been  found  to  be  most  prevalent  in  children  ages  4  to  11, infecting  more  males  than  females. [32]   Low  socioeconomic  status  was  found  to  be  a  risk  factor  for Tinea capitis . [32]   Throughout  Africa,  dermatophytoses  are  common  in  hot-  humid  climates  and  with  areas  of overpopulation. [32]\n\nChronicity is a common outcome for dermatophytosis in India. [33]  The prevalence of dermatophytosis in India is between 36.6 and 78.4% depending on the area, clinical subtype, and dermatophyte isolate. [33]  Individuals ages 21-40 years are most commonly affected. [33]\n\nA 2002 study looking at 445 samples of dermatophytes in patients in Goiânia, Brazil found the most prevalent type to be Trichophyton  rubrum (49.4%),  followed  by Trichophyton  mentagrophytes (30.8%),  and Microsporum canis (12.6%). [36]\n\nA 2013 study looking at 5,175 samples of Tinea in patients in Tehran, Iran found the most prevalent type to be Tinea pedis (43.4%), followed by Tinea unguium .
