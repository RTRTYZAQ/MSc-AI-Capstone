[4]  When it affects the mouth, in some countries it is commonly called thrush . [3]  Signs and symptoms include white patches on the tongue or other areas of the mouth and  throat. [3]   Other  symptoms  may  include  soreness  and problems  swallowing. [9]   When  it  affects  the  vagina,  it  may  be referred  to  as  a yeast  infection or thrush . [2][10]   Signs  and symptoms  include  genital  itching,  burning,  and  sometimes  a white \"cottage cheese-like\" discharge from the vagina. [11]  Yeast infections  of  the  penis  are  less  common  and  typically  present with an itchy rash. [11]  Very rarely, yeast infections may become invasive,  spreading  to  other  parts  of  the  body. [12]   This  may result in fevers, among other symptoms. [12]  Finally, candidiasis of  the  esophagus  is  an  important  risk  factor  for  contracting esophageal cancer in individuals with achalasia. [13]",

[4]  When it affects the mouth, in some countries it is commonly called thrush . [3]  Signs and symptoms include white patches on the tongue or other areas of the mouth and  throat. [3]   Other  symptoms  may  include  soreness  and problems  swallowing. [9]   When  it  affects  the  vagina,  it  may  be referred  to  as  a yeast  infection or thrush . [2][10]   Signs  and symptoms  include  genital  itching,  burning,  and  sometimes  a white \"cottage cheese-like\" discharge from the vagina. [11]  Yeast infections  of  the  penis  are  less  common  and  typically  present with an itchy rash. [11]  Very rarely, yeast infections may become invasive,  spreading  to  other  parts  of  the  body. [12]   This  may result in fevers, among other symptoms. [12]  Finally, candidiasis of  the  esophagus  is  an  important  risk  factor  for  contracting esophageal cancer in individuals with achalasia. [13]\n\nMore  than  20  types  of Candida may  cause  infection  with Candida albicans being the most common. [14]  Infections of the mouth are most common among children less than one month old,  the  elderly,  and  those  with  weak  immune  systems. [5] Conditions  that  result  in  a  weak  immune  system  include HIV/AIDS,  the  medications  used  after  organ  transplantation, diabetes,  and  the  use  of  corticosteroids. [5]   Other  risk  factors include during breastfeeding, following antibiotic therapy, and the  wearing  of  dentures. [5][15]   Vaginal  infections  occur  more commonly  during  pregnancy,  in  those  with  weak  immune systems, and following antibiotic therapy. [16]  Individuals at risk for invasive candidiasis include low birth weight babies, people recovering  from  surgery,  people  admitted  to  intensive  care units,  and  those  with  an  otherwise  compromised  immune system. [17]\n\nEfforts  to  prevent  infections  of  the  mouth  include  the  use  of chlorhexidine mouthwash in those with poor immune function and  washing  out  the  mouth  following  the  use  of  inhaled steroids.

        "text": "# Signs and symptoms\n\nSigns  and  symptoms  of  candidiasis  vary  depending  on  the  area affected. [23]  Most candidal infections result in minimal complications such  as  redness,  itching,  and  discomfort,  though  complications  may be  severe  or  even  fatal  if  left  untreated  in  certain  populations.  In healthy (immunocompetent) persons, candidiasis is usually a localized infection  of  the  skin,  fingernails  or  toenails  (onychomycosis),  or mucosal membranes, including the oral cavity and pharynx (thrush), esophagus,  and  the  sex  organs  (vagina,  penis,  etc.); [24][25][26]   less commonly in healthy individuals, the gastrointestinal tract, [27][28][29] urinary tract, [27] and respiratory tract [27] are sites of candida infection.\n\nIn immunocompromised  individuals, Candida infections in the esophagus occur more frequently than in healthy individuals and have a higher potential of becoming systemic, causing a much more serious condition,  a  fungemia  called  candidemia. [24][30][31]   Symptoms  of esophageal candidiasis include difficulty swallowing, painful swallowing, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. [24][32]\n\n\n## Mouth\n\nInfection in the mouth is characterized by white discolorations in the tongue,  around  the  mouth,  and  in  the  throat.  Irritation  may  also occur, causing discomfort when swallowing. [33]\n\nThrush is commonly seen in infants. It is not considered abnormal in infants unless it lasts longer than a few weeks. [34]\n\n\n## Genitals\n\nInfection  of  the  vagina  or  vulva  may  cause  severe  itching,  burning, soreness, irritation, and a whitish or whitish-gray cottage cheese-like discharge.  Symptoms  of  infection  of  the  male  genitalia  (balanitis thrush)  include  red  skin  around  the  head  of  the  penis,  swelling, irritation, itchiness and soreness of the head of the penis, thick, lumpy discharge  under  the  foreskin,  unpleasant  odour,  difficulty  retracting the  foreskin  (phimosis),  and  pain  when  passing  urine  or  during sex. [35]\n\n\n## Skin\n\nSigns  and  symptoms  of  candidiasis  in  the  skin  include  itching, irritation, and chafing or broken skin. [36]\n\n\n## Invasive infection\n\nCommon symptoms of gastrointestinal candidiasis in healthy individuals are anal itching, belching, bloating, indigestion, nausea,  diarrhea,  gas, intestinal cramps,  vomiting,  and  gastric  ulcers. [27][28][29]   Perianal candidiasis can cause anal itching; the lesion can be red, papular, or ulcerative in appearance, and it is not considered to be a sexually transmitted infection. [37]  Abnormal proliferation of the candida in the gut may lead  to  dysbiosis. [38]   While  it  is  not  yet  clear,  this  alteration  may  be  the  source  of  symptoms  generally described as the irritable bowel syndrome, [39][40]  and other gastrointestinal diseases.

        "text": "# Neurological symptoms\n\nSystemic candidiasis can affect the central nervous system, causing a variety of neurological symptoms, with a presentation similar to meningitis.\n\n\n## Causes\n\nCandida yeasts are generally present in healthy humans, frequently part of the human body's normal oral and intestinal flora, and particularly on the skin; however, their growth is normally limited by the human immune system and by competition of other microorganisms, such as bacteria occupying the same locations in the human body. [42] Candida requires  moisture  for  growth,  notably  on  the  skin. [43]   For  example,  wearing  wet swimwear for long periods of time is believed to be a risk factor. [44]  Candida can also cause diaper rashes in babies. [36]   In  extreme  cases,  superficial  infections  of  the  skin  or  mucous  membranes  may  enter  the bloodstream and cause systemic Candida infections. [45]\n\nFactors that increase the risk of candidiasis include HIV/AIDS, mononucleosis, cancer treatments, steroids, stress,  antibiotic  therapy,  diabetes,  and  nutrient  deficiency.  Hormone  replacement  therapy  and  infertility treatments may also be predisposing factors. [46]  Use of inhaled corticosteroids increases risk of candidiasis of the  mouth. [47]   Inhaled  corticosteroids  with  other  risk  factors  such  as  antibiotics,  oral  glucocorticoids,  not rinsing mouth after use of inhaled corticosteroids or high dose of inhaled corticosteroids put people at even higher risk. [47]  Treatment with antibiotics can lead to eliminating the yeast's natural competitors for resources in  the  oral  and  intestinal  flora,  thereby  increasing  the  severity  of  the  condition. [48]   A  weakened  or undeveloped  immune  system  or  metabolic  illnesses  are  significant  predisposing  factors  of  candidiasis. [49] Almost  15%  of  people  with  weakened  immune  systems  develop  a  systemic  illness  caused  by Candida species. [50]  Diets high in simple carbohydrates have been found to affect rates of oral candidiases. [51]\n\nC. albicans was isolated from the vaginas of 19% of apparently healthy women, i.e., those who experienced few or  no  symptoms of infection.  External  use  of  detergents  or  douches  or  internal  disturbances  (hormonal  or physiological) can perturb the normal vaginal flora, consisting of lactic acid bacteria, such as lactobacilli, and result  in  an  overgrowth  of Candida cells,  causing  symptoms  of  infection,  such  as  local  inflammation. [52] Pregnancy and the use of oral contraceptives have been reported as risk factors. [53]  Diabetes mellitus and the use of antibiotics are also linked to increased rates of yeast infections. [53]\n\nIn  penile  candidiasis,  the  causes  include  sexual  intercourse  with  an  infected  individual,  low  immunity, antibiotics,  and  diabetes.  Male  genital  yeast  infections  are  less  common,  but  a  yeast  infection  on  the  penis caused by direct contact via sexual intercourse with an infected partner is not uncommon. [54]\n\nBreastfeeding  mothers  may  develop  candidiasis  on  and  around  the  nipple  due  to  the  moisture  created  by excessive milk production. [15]\n\nVaginal candidiasis can cause congenital candidiasis in newborns. [55]\n\n\n## Diagnosis\n\nIn  oral  candidiasis,  simply  inspecting  the  person's  mouth  for  white  patches  and  irritation  may  make  the diagnosis.  A  sample  of  the  infected  area  may  also  be  taken  to  determine  what  organism  is  causing  the infection. [56]\n\nSymptoms  of  vaginal  candidiasis  are  also  present  in  the  more  common  bacterial  vaginosis; [57]   aerobic vaginitis  is  distinct  and  should  be  excluded  in  the  differential  diagnosis. [58]   In  a  2002  study,  only  33%  of women who were self-treating  for  a  yeast  infection  were  found  to  have  such  an  infection,  while  most  had either bacterial vaginosis or a mixed-type infection.

For  identification  by  light  microscopy,  a scraping or swab of the affected area is placed on a microscope slide. A single drop of 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution is then added to  the  specimen.  The  KOH  dissolves  the  skin  cells,  but  leaves  the Candida cells  intact,  permitting  visualization  of  pseudohyphae  and budding yeast cells typical of many Candida species. [60]\n\nFor the culturing method, a sterile swab is rubbed on the infected skin surface. The swab is then streaked on a culture medium. The culture is incubated at 37 °C (98.6 °F) for several days, allowing development of yeast  or  bacterial  colonies.  The  characteristics  (such  as  morphology and color) of the colonies may allow initial diagnosis of the organism causing disease symptoms. [61] Respiratory, gastrointestinal, and esophageal candidiasis require an endoscopy to diagnose. [29][62]  For gastrointestinal  candidiasis,  it  is  necessary  to  obtain  a  3-5  milliliter sample  of  fluid  from  the  duodenum  for  fungal  culture.

[42][51]   While  yeast  infections  are  associated  with diabetes, the level of blood sugar control may not affect the risk. [67] Wearing cotton underwear may help to reduce the risk of developing skin and vaginal yeast infections, along with not wearing wet clothes for  long  periods. [16][44]   For  women  who  experience  recurrent  yeast infections, there is limited evidence that oral or intravaginal probiotics help to prevent future infections. [18][68]  This includes either as pills or as yogurt. [18]\n\nOral  hygiene  can  help  prevent  oral  candidiasis  when  people  have  a weakened immune system. [5] For people undergoing cancer treatment, chlorhexidine mouthwash can prevent or reduce thrush. [5] People who  use  inhaled corticosteroids can reduce the risk of developing  oral  candidiasis  by  rinsing  the  mouth  with  water  or mouthwash  after  using  the  inhaler. [5]   People  with  dentures  should also disinfect their dentures regularly to prevent oral candidiasis.

[21] Gastrointestinal candidiasis in immunocompetent individuals is treated with 100-200 mg fluconazole per day for 2-3 weeks. [29]\n\n\n# Localized infection\n\nMouth and throat candidiasis are treated with antifungal medication. Oral candidiasis usually  responds  to topical treatments; otherwise, systemic antifungal medication may be indicated for oral infections. Candidal skin infections in the skin folds (candidal intertrigo) typically respond well to topical antifungal treatments (e.g., nystatin or miconazole). For breastfeeding mothers, topical miconazole is the most effective treatment for treating candidiasis on the breasts. [69]  Gentian violet can be used for thrush in breastfeeding babies. [15] Systemic treatment with antifungals by mouth is reserved for severe cases or if treatment with topical therapy is  unsuccessful.  Candida  esophagitis  may  be  treated  orally  or  intravenously.  For  severe  or  azole-resistant esophageal candidiasis, treatment with amphotericin B may be necessary. [6]\n\nVaginal yeast infections are typically treated with topical antifungal agents. [21]  Penile yeast infections are also treated with antifungal agents, but while an internal treatment may be used (such as a pessary) for vaginal yeast infections, only external treatments - such as a cream - can be recommended for penile treatment. [70]  A one-time dose of fluconazole by mouth is 90% effective in treating a vaginal yeast infection. [71]  For severe nonrecurring  cases,  several  doses  of  fluconazole  is  recommended. [21]   Local  treatment  may  include  vaginal suppositories or medicated douches. Other types of yeast infections require different dosing. C. albicans can develop resistance to fluconazole, this being more of an issue in those with HIV/AIDS who are often treated with multiple courses of fluconazole for recurrent oral infections. [72]\n\nFor vaginal yeast infection in pregnancy, topical imidazole or triazole antifungals are considered the therapy of  choice  owing  to  available  safety  data. [73]   Systemic  absorption  of  these  topical  formulations  is  minimal, posing little risk of transplacental transfer. [73]  In vaginal yeast infection in pregnancy, treatment with topical azole antifungals is recommended for seven days instead of a shorter duration. [73]\n\nFor  vaginal  yeast  infections,  many  complementary  treatments  are  proposed;  however,  several  have  side effects. [74]  No benefit from probiotics has been found for active infections. [19]\n\n\n## Blood-borne infection\n\nCandidemia  occurs  when  any  Candida  species  infects  the  blood.  Its  treatment  typically  consists  of  oral  or intravenous antifungal medications. [75]  Examples include intravenous fluconazole or an echinocandin such as caspofungin may be used. [21]  Amphotericin B is another option. [21]\n\n\n## Prognosis\n\nIn hospitalized patients who develop candidemia, age is an important prognostic factor. Mortality following candidemia is  50% in  patients  aged  ≥75  years  and  24%  in  patients  aged  <75  years. [76]   Among  individuals being  treated  in  intensive  care  units,  the  mortality  rate  is  about  30-50%  when  systemic  candidiasis develops. [77]\n\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nOral  candidiasis  is  the  most  common  fungal  infection  of  the  mouth, [78]   and  it  also  represents  the  most common opportunistic oral infection in humans. [79]  Infections of the mouth occur in about 6% of babies less than a month old. [7]  About 20% of those receiving chemotherapy for cancer and 20% of those with AIDS also develop the disease. [7]"

[87]\n\nThe colloquial term \"thrush\" is of unknown origin but may stem from an unrecorded Old English word *þrusc or a Scandinavian root. The term is not related to the bird of the same name. [88]  The term candidosis is largely used in British English, and candidiasis in American English. [86] Candida is  also pronounced differently; in American English, the stress is on the \"i\", whereas in British English the stress is on the first syllable. [86]\n\nThe  genus Candida and  species C.  albicans were  described  by  botanist  Christine  Marie  Berkhout  in  her doctoral thesis at the University of Utrecht in 1923. Over the years, the classification of the genera and species has evolved. Obsolete names for this genus include Mycotorula and Torulopsis .  The  species  has  also  been known  in  the  past as Monilia  albicans and Oidium  albicans . The  current classification is nomen conservandum ,  which  means  the  name  is  authorized  for  use  by  the  International  Botanical  Congress (IBC). [89]\n\nThe  genus Candida includes  about  150  different  species.  However,  only  a  few  are  known  to  cause  human infections. C. albicans is the most significant pathogenic species. Other species pathogenic in humans include C. auris , C. tropicalis , C. parapsilosis , C. dubliniensis , and C. lusitaniae .\n\nThe name Candida was proposed by Berkhout. It is from the Latin word toga candida , referring to the white toga (robe) worn by candidates for the Senate of the ancient Roman republic. [86]  The specific epithet albicans also comes from Latin, albicare meaning \"to whiten\". [86]  These names refer to the generally white appearance of Candida species when cultured.\n\n\n## Alternative medicine\n\nA 2005 publication noted that \"a large pseudoscientific cult\" [90]  has developed around the topic of Candida , with claims stating that up to one in three people are affected by yeast-related illness, particularly a condition called  \"Candidiasis  hypersensitivity\". [91]   Some  practitioners  of  alternative  medicine  have  promoted  these purported  conditions  and  sold  dietary  supplements  as  supposed  cures;  a  number  of  them  have  been prosecuted. [91][92]  In 1990, alternative health vendor Nature's Way signed an FTC consent agreement not to misrepresent in advertising any self-diagnostic test concerning yeast conditions or to make any unsubstantiated representation concerning any food or supplement's ability to control yeast conditions, with a fine of $30,000 payable to the National Institutes of Health for research in genuine candidiasis.
