[5][13] Different types are traditionally divided according to the part of the body affected: superficial, subcutaneous,  and  systemic. [3][6]   Superficial  fungal  infections include  common  tinea  of  the  skin,  such  as  tinea  of  the  body, groin,  hands,  feet  and  beard,  and  yeast  infections  such  as pityriasis versicolor. [7]  Subcutaneous types include eumycetoma and chromoblastomycosis, which generally affect tissues in and beneath  the  skin. [1][7]   Systemic  fungal  infections  are  more serious and include cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, pneumocystis  pneumonia,  aspergillosis  and  mucormycosis. [3] Signs  and  symptoms  range  widely. [3]   There  is  usually  a  rash with superficial infection. [2]  Fungal infection within the skin or under  the  skin  may  present  with  a  lump  and  skin  changes. [3] Pneumonia-like  symptoms  or  meningitis  may  occur  with  a deeper or systemic infection. [2]",

        "text": "# Prevention\n\nKeeping the skin clean and dry, as well as maintaining good hygiene, will help larger topical mycoses. Because some fungal infections are contagious, it is important to wash hands after touching other people or animals. Sports clothing should also be washed after use.\n\n\n## Treatment\n\nTreatment  depends  on  the  type  of  fungal  infection,  and  usually  requires  topical  or  systemic  antifungal medicines. [15]   Pneumocystosis  that  does  not  respond  to  anti-fungals  is  treated  with  co-trimoxazole. [29] Sometimes, infected tissue needs to be surgically cut away. [3]\n\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nWorldwide,  every  year  fungal  infections  affect  more  than  one  billion  people. [11]   An  estimated  1.6  million deaths from fungal disease were reported in 2017. [30]  The figure has been rising, with an estimated 1.7 million deaths from fungal disease reported in 2020. [12]  Fungal infections also constitute a significant cause of illness and mortality in children. [31]\n\nAccording to the Global Action Fund for Fungal Infections, every year there are over 10 million cases of fungal asthma, around 3 million cases of long-term aspergillosis of lungs, 1 million cases of blindness due to fungal keratitis, more than 200,000 cases of meningitis due to cryptococcus, 700,000 cases of invasive candidiasis, 500,000  cases  of  pneumocystosis  of  lungs,  250,000  cases  of  invasive  aspergillosis,  and  100,000  cases  of histoplasmosis. [32]\n\n\n## History\n\nIn  500  BC,  an  account  of  ulcers  in  the  mouth  by  Hippocrates  may  have  described  thrush. [33]   Paris-based Hungarian microscopist David Gruby first reported that human disease could be caused by fungi in the early 1840s. [33]\n\n\n## SARS 2003\n\nDuring the 2003 SARS outbreak, fungal infections were reported in 14.8-33% of people affected by SARS, and it was the cause of death in 25-73.7% of people with SARS. [34]\n\n\n## Other animals\n\nA wide range of fungal infections occur in other animals, and some can be transmitted from animals to people, such as Microsporum canis from cats.
