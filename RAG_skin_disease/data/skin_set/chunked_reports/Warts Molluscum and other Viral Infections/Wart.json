There  are  about  130  known  types  of  human papillomaviruses. [9]  HPV infects the squamous epithelium, usually of the skin or genitals. Each HPV type is typically only able to infect a few specific areas of the body. Many HPV types can produce a benign growth, often called a \"wart\" or \"papilloma\", in the area they infect. [10]  Many of the more common HPV and wart types are listed below.\n\n\n- Common warts - HPV types 2 and 4 (most common); also types 1, 3, 26, 29, and 57, and others.\n- Cancers and genital dysplasia - \"high-risk\" HPV types are associated with cancers, notably cervical cancer, and can also cause some vulvar, vaginal, [11] penile, anal [12]  and some oropharyngeal cancers. \"Low-risk\" types are associated with warts or other conditions. [13][14]\n- High-risk: 16, 18 (cause the most cervical cancer); also 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 52, 58, 59, and others.\n- Plantar warts (verruca) - HPV type 1 (most common); also types 2, 4, 27, 28, and others.\n- Anogenital warts (condylomata acuminata or venereal warts) - HPV types 6 and 11 (most common); also types 42, 44, and others. [15]\n- Low-risk: 6, 11 (most common); also 13, 44, 40, 43, 42, 54, 61, 72, 81, 89, and others.\n- Verruca plana (flat warts) - HPV types 3, 10, and 28.\n- Butcher's warts - HPV type 7.\n- Heck's disease (focal epithelial hyperplasia) - HPV types 13 and 32.\n\n\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nCommon warts have a characteristic appearance under the microscope. They have thickening of the stratum corneum  (hyperkeratosis),  thickening  of  the  stratum  spinosum  (acanthosis),  thickening  of  the  stratum granulosum, rete ridge elongation, and large blood vessels at the dermoepidermal junction.\n\n\n## Diagnosis\n\nOn dermatoscopic examination, warts will commonly have fingerlike or knoblike extensions.

        "text": "# Prevention\n\nGardasil 6 is an HPV vaccine aimed at preventing cervical cancers and genital warts. Gardasil is designed to prevent infection with HPV types 16, 18, 6, and 11. HPV types 16 and 18 currently cause about 70% of cervical  cancer  cases, [13][14]   and  also  cause  some  vulvar,  vaginal, [11] penile  and  anal  cancers. [12]   HPV  types  6  and  11  are  responsible  for 90% of documented cases of genital warts. [17]\n\nGardasil 9 protects against HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. [18]\n\nHPV  vaccines  do  not  currently  protect  against  the  virus  strains responsible for plantar warts (verrucae). [19]\n\n\n## Disinfection\n\nThe virus is relatively hardy and immune to many common disinfectants. Exposure to 90% ethanol for at least 1  minute,  2%  glutaraldehyde,  30%  Chlorhexidine,  and/or  1%  sodium  hypochlorite  can  disinfect  the pathogen. [20]\n\nThe  virus  is  resistant  to  drying  and  heat,  but  killed  by  100  °C  (212  °F)  temperature  and  ultraviolet radiation. [20]\n\n\n## Treatment\n\nThere are many treatments and procedures associated with wart removal. [21]  A review of various skin wart treatments concluded that topical treatments containing salicylic acid were more effective than placebo. [22] Cryotherapy appears to be as effective as salicylic acid, but there have been fewer trials. [22]\n\n\n## Medication\n\n\n- Salicylic acid can be prescribed by a dermatologist in a higher concentration than that found in overthe-counter products. Several over-the-counter products are readily available at pharmacies and supermarkets of roughly two types: adhesive pads treated with salicylic acid, and bottled concentrated salicylic acid and lactic acid solution.\n- Fluorouracil - Fluorouracil cream, a chemotherapy agent sometimes used to treat skin cancer, can be used on particularly resistant warts, by blocking viral DNA and RNA production and repair. [23]\n- Imiquimod is a topical cream that helps the body's immune system fight the wart virus by encouraging interferon production. It has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for genital warts. [24]\n- Cantharidin, found naturally in the bodies of many members of the beetle family Meloidae, causes dermal blistering. It is used either by itself or compounded with podophyllin. Not FDA approved, but available through Canada or select US compounding pharmacies.\n- Bleomycin - A more potent chemotherapy drug, can be injected into deep warts, destroying the viral DNA or RNA. Bleomycin is notably not US FDA approved for this purpose. Possible side effects include necrosis of the digits, nail loss, and Raynaud syndrome. The usual treatment is one or two injections.

        "text": "- Dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), like salicylic acid, is applied directly to the wart. Studies show this method is effective with a cure rate of 80%. But DNCB must be used much more cautiously than salicylic acid; the chemical is known to cause genetic mutations, so it must be administered by a physician. This drug induces an allergic immune response, resulting in inflammation that wards off the wart-causing virus. [27]\n- Cidofovir is an antiviral drug which is injected into HPV lesions within the larynx (laryngeal papillomatosis) as an experimental treatment. [28]\n- Verrutop verruca treatment is a topical solution made from a combination of organic acids, inorganic acids, and metal ions. This solution causes the production of nitrites, which act to denature viral proteins and mummify the wart tissue. The difference between Verrutop and other acid treatments is that it does not damage the surrounding skin.\n- Another product available over-the-counter that can aid in wart removal is silver nitrate in the form of a caustic pencil, which is also available at drug stores. In a placebo-controlled study of 70 patients, silver nitrate given over nine days resulted in clearance of all warts in 43% and improvement in warts in  26 % one month after treatment, compared to 11% and 14%, respectively, in the placebo group. [29] The instructions must be followed to minimize staining of skin and clothing. Occasionally, pigmented scars may develop.\n- Trichloroacetic acid can be used to treat warts if salicylic acid or cryotherapy fail or are not available. It requires repeat treatments every week or so. Side effects are burning and stinging. [30]\n\n\n\n## Procedures\n\n\n- Keratolysis, of dead surface skin cells usually using salicylic acid, blistering agents, immune system modifiers (\"immunomodulators\"), or formaldehyde, often with mechanical paring of the wart with a pumice stone, blade etc. [ 31 ]\n- Electrodesiccation [ 32 ]\n- Microwave Treatment [33][34][35][36][37][38]\n- Cryosurgery or cryotherapy, which involves freezing the wart (generally with liquid nitrogen), [ 39 ] creating a blister between the wart and epidermal layer after which the wart and the surrounding"

[40]\n- Surgical curettage of the wart\n- Laser treatment - often with a pulse dye laser or carbon dioxide (CO2) laser. Pulse dye lasers (wavelength 582 nm) work by selective absorption by blood cells (specifically hemoglobin). CO2 lasers work by selective absorption by water molecules. Pulse dye lasers are less destructive and more likely to heal without scarring. CO2 laser works by vaporizing and destroying tissue and skin. Laser treatments can be painful, expensive (though covered by many insurance plans), and not extensively scarring when used appropriately. CO2 lasers will require local anaesthetic. Pulse dye laser treatment does not need conscious sedation or local anesthesia. It takes 2 to 4 treatments, but can be many more for extreme cases. Typically, 10-14 days are required between treatments. Preventive measures are important. [40]\n- principle as laser treatment. It is less expensive. Like the laser, it can cause blistering, pain, and\n- Infrared coagulator - an intense source of infrared light in a small beam like a laser. This works essentially on the same scarring. [41]\n- Intralesional immunotherapy with purified candida, MMR, and tuberculin (PPD) protein appears safe and effective. [42][43]\n- Duct tape occlusion therapy involves placing a piece of duct tape over the wart. The mechanism of action of this technique still remains unknown. Despite several trials, evidence for the efficacy of duct tape therapy is inconclusive. [44][45]  Despite the mixed evidence for efficacy, the simplicity of the method and its limited side-effects lead some researchers to be reluctant to dismiss it. [46]\n- No intervention. Spontaneous resolution within a few years can be recommended. [47]\n\n\n\n## Alternative medicine\n\nDaily  application  of  the  acrid  yellow  latex  of  Chelidonium  majus  (greater  celandine)  is  a  traditional treatment. [48][49]\n\nA variety of traditional folk remedies and rituals claim to be able to remove warts. According to English folk belief, touching toads causes warts; according to a German folk belief, touching a toad under a full moon cures warts. [50]   The  most  common  Northern  Hemisphere  toads  have  glands  that  protrude  from  their  skin  that superficially resemble warts. Warts are caused by a virus, and toads do not harbor it.

        "text": "In The  Adventures  of  Tom  Sawyer ,  Mark  Twain  has  his  characters discuss  a  variety  of  such  remedies.  Tom  Sawyer  proposes  \"spunkwater\" (or \"stump-water\", the water collecting in the hollow of a tree stump) as a remedy for warts on the hand. In his version, one puts one's hand into the water at midnight and says:\n\nBarley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal shorts, Spunk-water, spunk-water, swaller these warts\n\nOne would then \"walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody. Because if you speak the charm's busted.\" This is given as an\n\nexample of Huckleberry Finn's planned remedy, which involves throwing a dead cat into a graveyard as a devil or devils comes to collect a recently buried wicked person. Another remedy involved splitting a bean, drawing blood from the wart and putting one of the bean halves against the wart, and burying that half at a crossroads at midnight. The theory of operation is that the blood on the buried bean will draw away the wart. [52]  Twain is recognized as an early collector and recorder of genuine American folklore. [53]\n\nSimilar practices are recorded elsewhere. In Louisiana, one remedy for warts involves rubbing the wart with a potato, which is then buried; when the \"buried potato dries up, the wart will be cured\". [54]  Another remedy similar to Twain's is reported from Northern Ireland, where water from a specific well on Rathlin Island is credited with the power to cure warts. [55]\n\n\n## History\n\nSurviving ancient medical texts show that warts were a documented disease  since  at  least  the  time  of  Hippocrates,  who  lived  c. 460  c.  370  BC.  In  the  book De  Medecia by  the  Roman  physician  Aulus Cornelius  Celsus,  who  lived  c.  25  BC  -  c.  50  AD,  different  types  of warts  were  described.  Celsus  described myrmecia ,  today  recognized as plantar wart, and categorized the acrochordon (skin tag) as a wart. In the 13th century, warts were described in books published by the surgeons William of Saliceto and Lanfranc of Milan. The word verruca for  a  wart  was  introduced  by  the  physician  Daniel  Sennert,  who described them in his 1636 book Hypomnemata physicae . [56]\n\nThe cause of warts was initially disputed in the medical profession. In the early 18th century, the physician Daniel Turner, who published the first  book  on  dermatology,  suggested  that  warts  were  caused  by\n\ndamaged nerves close to the skin. In the mid-18th century, the surgeon John Hunter popularized the belief that warts were caused by a bacterial syphilis infection. The surgeon Benjamin Bell documented that warts were  caused  by  a  disease  entirely  unrelated  to  syphilis,  and  established  a  causal  link  between  warts  and cancer.  In  the  19th  century,  the  chief  physician  of  Verona  Hospital  established  a  link  between  warts  and cervical cancer in particular. But in 1874, it was noted by the dermatologist Ferdinand Ritter von Hebra that while various theories were advanced by the medical profession, the \"influences causing warts are still very obscure\". [56]\n\nIn  1907,  the  physician  Giuseppe  Ciuffo  first  demonstrated  that  a  viral  infection  causes  warts.  In  1976,  the virologist Harald zur Hausen was the first to discover that warts were caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). His continuous research established the evidence necessary to develop an HPV vaccine, which first became available in 2006. [56]"
