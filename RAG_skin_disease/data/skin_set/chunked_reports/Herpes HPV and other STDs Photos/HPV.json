[5][7][8]   Many  HPV  infections  cause  no  symptoms  and 90% resolve  spontaneously  within  two  years. [1]   Sometimes  an HPV  infection  persists  and  results  in  warts  or  precancerous lesions. [2]   Many  warts  are  caused  by  HPV.  These  lesions, depending on the site affected, increase the risk of cancer of the cervix, vulva, vagina, penis, anus, mouth, tonsils, or throat. [1][2][3]   Nearly all cervical cancer is due to HPV and two strains, HPV16 and HPV18, account for 70% of all cases. [1][9] HPV16 is responsible for almost 90% of HPV-related cancers of the  mouth,  throat,  or  tonsils. [3]   Between  60%  and  90%  of  the other cancers listed above are also linked to HPV. [9] HPV6 and HPV11 are  common  causes  of  genital  warts  and  laryngeal papillomatosis. [1]",

[5][13] More than 40 types may be spread through sexual contact and infect the anus  and  genitals.

[14]  HPV infection can spread from a mother to  baby  during  pregnancy.

Warts are  caused  by  the  rapid  growth  of  cells  on  the  outer  layer  of  the skin. [30]\n\nWhile cases of warts have been described since ancient Greece, their viral  cause  was  not  known  until  1907,  when  Dr.  Giuseppe  Ciuffo showed  their  viral  nature  by  inoculating  a  wart  extract  into  the skin. [31]\n\nSkin  warts  are  most  common  in  childhood  and  typically  appear  and  regress  spontaneously  over  weeks  to months. Recurrence is common. [32]\n\nTypes of warts include:",

Cutaneous HPV types can cause genital warts but are not associated with the development of cancer. [33]\n- Plantar warts are found on the soles of the feet; they grow inward, generally causing pain when walking. [33]\n- Subungual or periungual warts form under the fingernail (subungual), around the fingernail, or on the cuticle (periungual). They are more difficult to treat than warts in other locations. [34]\n- Flat warts are most commonly found on the arms, face, or forehead. Like common warts, flat warts occur most frequently in children and teens. In people with normal immune function, flat warts are not associated with the development of cancer. [35]\n\n\n\n## Genital warts\n\nHPV infection of the skin in the genital area is the most common sexually transmitted infection worldwide. [36] Such  infections  are  associated  with  genital  or  anal  warts  (medically  known  as  condylomata  acuminata  or venereal warts) and these warts can be diagnosed on visual inspection and confirmed by biopsy.

A wide variety of HPV types can cause genital warts, but types 6 and 11 together account for about 90% of all cases.

People  may  transmit  the  virus  to  others  even  if  they  do  not  display  overt symptoms of infection. [14]\n\nMost people acquire genital HPV infections at some point in their lives, and about 10% of women are currently infected. [36]\n\n\n## Laryngeal papillomatosis\n\nIn addition to genital warts, infection by HPV types 6 and 11 can cause a rare condition known as recurrent laryngeal papillomatosis, in which warts form on the larynx [40]  or other areas of the respiratory tract. [41][42] These warts can recur frequently, may interfere with breathing, and in extremely rare cases can progress to cancer. For these reasons, repeated surgery to remove the warts may be advisable.

[5][7][8]   Many  HPV  infections  cause  no  symptoms  and 90% resolve  spontaneously  within  two  years. [1]   Sometimes  an HPV  infection  persists  and  results  in  warts  or  precancerous lesions. [2]   Many  warts  are  caused  by  HPV.  These  lesions, depending on the site affected, increase the risk of cancer of the cervix, vulva, vagina, penis, anus, mouth, tonsils, or throat. [1][2][3]   Nearly all cervical cancer is due to HPV and two strains, HPV16 and HPV18, account for 70% of all cases. [1][9] HPV16 is responsible for almost 90% of HPV-related cancers of the  mouth,  throat,  or  tonsils. [3]   Between  60%  and  90%  of  the other cancers listed above are also linked to HPV. [9] HPV6 and HPV11 are  common  causes  of  genital  warts  and  laryngeal papillomatosis. [1]\n\nOver 200 types of HPV  have been described. [10][11]   An individual  can  become  infected  with  more  than  one  type  of HPV [12]   and  the  disease  is  only  known  to  affect  humans. [5][13] More than 40 types may be spread through sexual contact and infect the anus  and  genitals. [4] Risk  factors for  persistent infection by sexually transmitted types include early age of first sexual intercourse, multiple sexual partners, smoking and poor immune function. [1]   These  types  are  typically  spread  by  direct skin-to-skin contact, with vaginal and anal sex being the most common methods. [14]  HPV infection can spread from a mother to  baby  during  pregnancy.

[16]\n\nHPV vaccines can prevent the most common types of infection. [4]  Many public health organisations now test directly for HPV. [17][18]  Screening allows for early treatment, which results in better outcomes. [1]  Nearly every sexually  active  individual  is  infected  with  HPV  at  some  point  in  their  lives. [4]   HPV  is  the  most  common sexually transmitted infection (STI), globally. [5]\n\nHigh-risk  HPVs  cause  about  5%  of  all  cancers  worldwide  and  about  37,300  cases  of  cancer  in  the  United States  each  year. [11]   Cervical  cancer  is  among  the  most  common  cancers  worldwide,  causing  an  estimated 604,000  new  cases  and  342,000  deaths  in  2020. [1]   About  90%  of  these  new  cases  and  deaths  of  cervical cancer  occurred  in  low  and  middle  income  countries. [1]   Roughly  1%  of  sexually  active  adults  have  genital warts. [12]\n\n\n## HPV types\n\nHPV is a group of more than 200 viruses, which are designated by a number for each virus type. [11]  Some HPV types,  such  as  HPV5,  may  establish  infections  that  persist  for  the  lifetime  of  the  individual,  without manifesting any clinical symptoms.

[1][2]  HPV type 16 is the strain most likely to cause cancer and is present in about 47% of all cervical cancers, [23][24]  and in many vaginal and vulvar cancers, [25]  penile cancers, anal cancers and cancers of the head and neck.\n\nThe table below lists common symptoms of HPV infection and the associated types of HPV.\n\n\n| Disease                              | HPV type                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Common warts                         | 2,  7 ,  22                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Plantar warts                        | 1,  2 ,  4 ,  63                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Flat warts                           | 3,  10 ,  28                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Anogenital warts                     | 6,  11 ,  42 ,  44 , and others [ 26 ]                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Anal dysplasia (lesions)             | 16, 18, 31, 53, 58 [27]                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Genital cancers                      | Highest risk: [ 26 ]   16 ,  18 ,  31 ,  45 Other high-risk: [ 11 ][ 26 ]   33 ,  35 ,  39 ,  51 ,  52 ,  56 ,  58 ,  59 ,  66 ,  68 Probably high-risk: [ 28 ]   26 ,  53 ,  73 ,  82 |\n| Epidermodysplasia verruciformis      | more than 15 types                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Focal epithelial hyperplasia (mouth) | 13, 32                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Mouth papillomas                     | 6,  7 ,  11 ,  16 ,  32                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Oropharyngeal cancer                 | 16 [3]                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Verrucous cyst                       | 60                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Laryngeal papillomatosis             | 6,  11                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n\n\n\n## Conditions and diseases\n\n\n## Warts\n\nSkin  infection  (\"cutaneous\"  infection)  with  HPV  is  common [29]   and can cause noncancerous skin growths called warts (verrucae). Warts are  caused  by  the  rapid  growth  of  cells  on  the  outer  layer  of  the skin. [30]\n\nWhile cases of warts have been described since ancient Greece, their viral  cause  was  not  known  until  1907,  when  Dr.  Giuseppe  Ciuffo showed  their  viral  nature  by  inoculating  a  wart  extract  into  the skin. [31]\n\nSkin  warts  are  most  common  in  childhood  and  typically  appear  and  regress  spontaneously  over  weeks  to months. Recurrence is common. [32]\n\nTypes of warts include:"

        "text": "- Common warts are usually found on the hands and feet, but can also occur in other areas, such as the elbows or knees. Cutaneous HPV types can cause genital warts but are not associated with the development of cancer. [33]\n- Plantar warts are found on the soles of the feet; they grow inward, generally causing pain when walking. [33]\n- Subungual or periungual warts form under the fingernail (subungual), around the fingernail, or on the cuticle (periungual). They are more difficult to treat than warts in other locations. [34]\n- Flat warts are most commonly found on the arms, face, or forehead. Like common warts, flat warts occur most frequently in children and teens. In people with normal immune function, flat warts are not associated with the development of cancer. [35]\n\n\n\n## Genital warts\n\nHPV infection of the skin in the genital area is the most common sexually transmitted infection worldwide. [36] Such  infections  are  associated  with  genital  or  anal  warts  (medically  known  as  condylomata  acuminata  or venereal warts) and these warts can be diagnosed on visual inspection and confirmed by biopsy. [37]\n\nThe strains of HPV that can cause genital warts are usually different from those that cause warts on other parts of the body. A wide variety of HPV types can cause genital warts, but types 6 and 11 together account for about 90% of all cases. [38][39]\n\nThe great majority of genital HPV infections never cause any overt symptoms and are cleared by the immune system  in  a  matter  of  months.  People  may  transmit  the  virus  to  others  even  if  they  do  not  display  overt symptoms of infection. [14]\n\nMost people acquire genital HPV infections at some point in their lives, and about 10% of women are currently infected. [36]\n\n\n## Laryngeal papillomatosis\n\nIn addition to genital warts, infection by HPV types 6 and 11 can cause a rare condition known as recurrent laryngeal papillomatosis, in which warts form on the larynx [40]  or other areas of the respiratory tract. [41][42] These warts can recur frequently, may interfere with breathing, and in extremely rare cases can progress to cancer. For these reasons, repeated surgery to remove the warts may be advisable. [41][43]\n\n\n## Cancer\n\n\n## Case statistics\n\nCervical cancer is among the most common cancers worldwide, causing an estimated 604,000 new cases and 342,000 deaths in 2020. [1]   About  90% of these new cases and deaths occurred in low and middle income countries, where screening tests and treatment of early cervical cell changes are not readily available. [1]\n\nIn  the  USA,  cervical  cancer  accounts  for  0.7%  of  new  cancer  cases. [44]   Oral  cavity  and  pharynx  cancer accounts for 2.9% of new cancer cases and predominantly affects men. [45]  HPV is thought to cause 60% to 70% of oropharyngeal cancers. [46]  37,300 cases of cancer, caused by HPV, occur each year. [11]"

Lingering  infection  with  high-risk  HPV  types,  such  as types 16, 18, 31, and 45, can favor the development of cancer. [48]  Cofactors  such  as  cigarette  smoke  can  also  enhance  the  risk  of  HPVrelated cancers. [49][50]\n\nHPV is believed to cause cancer by integrating its genome into nuclear DNA. Some of the early genes expressed by HPV, such as E6 and E7, act as oncogenes that promote tumor growth and malignant transformation. [31] HPV genome integration can also cause carcinogenesis by promoting  genomic  instability associated  with alterations in DNA copy number. [51]\n\nE6 produces a protein (also  called  E6)  that  simultaneously  binds  to two host cell proteins called p53 and E6-Associated Protein (E6-AP). E6AP is an E3 Ubiquitin ligase,  an  enzyme  whose  purpose  is  to  tag proteins  with  a  post-translational  modification  called  Ubiquitin.  By binding both proteins, E6 induces E6AP to attach a chain of ubiquitin molecules to p53, thereby flagging p53 for proteosomal\n\ndegradation. [52][53]  Normally, p53 acts to prevent cell growth and promotes cell death in the presence of DNA damage.  p53  also  upregulates  the  p21  protein,  which  blocks  the  formation  of  the  cyclin  D/Cdk4  complex, thereby  preventing  the  phosphorylation  of  retinoblastoma  protein  (RB),  and  in  turn,  halting  cell  cycle progression by preventing the activation of E2F. In short, p53 is a tumor-suppressor protein that arrests the cell cycle and prevents cell growth and survival when DNA damage occurs. [54]  Thus, the degradation of p53, induced  by  E6,  promotes  unregulated  cell  division,  cell  growth,  and  cell  survival,  all  characteristics  of cancer. [55]\n\nIt  is  important  to  note  that  although  the  interaction  between  E6,  E6AP,  and  p53  was  the  first  to  be characterized, several other proteins in the host cell interact with E6, supporting the induction of cancer.

        "text": "# Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin\n\nStudies have also shown a link between a wide range of HPV types and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. In such cases, in vitro studies suggest that the E6 protein of the HPV virus may inhibit apoptosis induced by ultraviolet light. [57]\n\n\n## Cervical cancer\n\nNearly  all  cases  of  cervical  cancer  are  associated  with  HPV  infection,  with  two  types,  HPV16  and  HPV18, present  in  70%  of  cases. [1][9][23][58][59][60]   In  2012,  twelve  HPV  types  were  considered  carcinogenic  for cervical cancer by the International Agency for Research on Cancer: 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, and  59. [61]   One  study  found  that  74%  of  squamous  cell  carcinomas  and  78%  of  adenocarcinomas  tested positive  for  HPV  types  16  or  18. [62]   Persistent  HPV  infection  increases  the  risk  for  developing  cervical carcinoma.  Individuals  who  have  an  increased  incidence  of  these  types  of  infection  are  women  with HIV/AIDS, who are at a 22-fold increased risk of cervical cancer. [63][64]\n\nThe carcinogenic HPV types in cervical cancer belong to the alphapapillomavirus genus. They can be grouped further  into  HPV  clades. [65]   The  two  major  carcinogenic  HPV  clades,  alphapapillomavirus-9  (A9)  and alphapapillomavirus-7 (A7), contain HPV16 and HPV18, respectively. [66]  These two HPV clades were shown to  have  different  effects  on  tumour  molecular  characteristics  and  patient  prognosis,  with  clade  A7  being associated with more aggressive pathways and an inferior prognosis. [67]\n\nIn  2020,  about  604,000  new  cases  and  342,000  deaths  from  cervical  cancer  occurred  worldwide.  Around 90% of these occurred in the developing world. [1]\n\nMost HPV infections of the cervix are cleared rapidly by the immune system and do not progress to cervical cancer (see below the Clearance subsection in Virology). Because the process of transforming normal cervical cells into cancerous ones is slow, cancer occurs in people who have been infected with HPV for a long time, usually over a decade or more (persistent infection). [41][68]  Furthermore, both the HPV infection and cervical cancer drive metabolic modifications that may be correlated with the aberrant regulation of enzymes related to metabolic pathways. [69]\n\nNon-European  (NE)  HPV16  variants  are  significantly  more  carcinogenic  than  European  (E)  HPV16 variants. [70]\n\nInitially,  cervical  cancer  is  often  asymptomatic.  Symptoms  of  more  advanced  cervical  cancer  include  pain during sex, unusual vaginal bleeding, changes to vaginal discharge, lower back pain, and pelvic pain. [71][72][73][74]\n\n\n## Anal cancer\n\nWomen and men who have HPV are at increased risk of developing anal cancer. Most cases (90%) are linked HPV infection. [75][76]\n\nThe risk for anal cancer is 17 to 31 times higher among HIV-positive individuals who were co-infected with high-risk HPV, and 80 times higher for HIV-positive men who have sex with men. [77]\n\nA literature review of studies and meta-analysis concluded that HPV16 was most carcinogenic, regardless of whether a person is HIV positive or negative, and that detecting the presence of HPV16 should be a priority for anal cancer prevention. [78]\n\n\n## Penile cancer\n\nHPV is associated with approximately 50% of penile cancers. In the United States, penile cancer accounts for about 0.5% of all cancer cases in men. HPV16 is the most commonly detected associated type. The risk of penile cancer increases 2- to 3-fold for individuals who are infected with HIV as well as HPV. [77]"

        "text": "# Head and neck cancers\n\nOral  infection  with  high-risk  carcinogenic  HPV  types  (most  commonly  HPV  16) [47]   is  associated  with  an increasing  number  of  head  and  neck  cancers. [79][59][80][81]   This  association  is  independent  of  tobacco  and alcohol use. [81][82][83]\n\nThe local percentage varies widely, from 70% in the United States [84]  to 4% in Brazil. [85]  Engaging in anal or oral sex with an HPV-infected partner may increase the risk of developing these types of cancers. [80]\n\nIn the United States, the number of newly diagnosed, HPV-associated head and neck cancers has surpassed that  of  cervical  cancer  cases. [79]   The  rate  of  such  cancers  has  increased  from  an  estimated  0.8  cases  per 100,000  people  in  1988 [86]   to  4.5  per  100,000  in  2012, [47]   and,  as  of  2021,  the  rate  has  continued  to increase. [87]   Researchers  explain  these  recent  data  by  an  increase  in  oral  sex.  This  type  of  cancer  is  more common in men than in women. [88]\n\nThe mutational profile of HPV-positive and HPV-negative head and neck cancer has been reported, further demonstrating that they are fundamentally distinct diseases. [89]\n\n\n## Lung cancer\n\nSome evidence links HPV to benign and malignant tumors of the upper respiratory tract. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has found that people with lung cancer were significantly more likely to have several high-risk forms of HPV antibodies compared to those who did not have lung cancer. [90]  Researchers looking  for  HPV  among  1,633  lung  cancer  patients  and  2,729  people  without  the  lung  disease  found  that people with lung cancer had more types of HPV than noncancer patients did, and among lung cancer patients, the chances of having eight types of serious HPV were significantly increased. [91]  In addition, expression of HPV structural proteins by immunohistochemistry and in  vitro studies  suggest  HPV presence in bronchial cancer and its  precursor  lesions. [92]   Another  study  detected  HPV  in  the  exhaled  breath  condensate  (EBC), bronchial brushing and neoplastic lung tissue of cases, and found a presence of an HPV infection in 16.4% of the  subjects  affected  by  nonsmall  cell  lung  cancer,  but  in  none  of  the  controls. [93]   The  reported  average frequencies of HPV in lung cancers were 17% and 15% in Europe and the Americas, respectively, and the mean number of HPV in Asian lung cancer samples was 35.7%, with considerable heterogeneity between certain countries and regions. [94]\n\n\n## Skin cancer\n\nIn  very  rare  cases,  HPV  may  cause  epidermodysplasia  verruciformis  (EV)  in  individuals  with  a  weakened immune system. The virus, unchecked by the immune system, causes the overproduction of keratin by skin cells,  resulting  in  lesions  resembling  warts  or  cutaneous  horns  which  can  ultimately  transform  into  skin cancer, but the development is not well understood. [95][96][97]  The specific types of HPV that are associated with EV are HPV5, HPV8, and HPV14. [96]\n\n\n## Cause\n\n\n## Transmission\n\nSexually transmitted HPV is divided into two categories: low-risk and high-risk. Low-risk HPVs cause warts on  or  around  the  genitals.  Types  6  and  11  cause  90%  of  all  genital  warts  and  recurrent  respiratory papillomatosis, which causes benign tumors in the air passages. High-risk HPVs cause cancer and consist of about twelve identified types. [11]  Types 16 and 18 are responsible for causing most of the HPV-caused cancers. These high-risk HPVs cause 5% of the cancers in the world. In the United States, high-risk HPVs cause 3% of all cancer cases in women and 2% in men. [98]"

        "text": "Risk factors for persistent genital HPV infections, which increase the risk of developing cancer, include early age of first sexual intercourse, multiple partners, smoking, and immunosuppression. [1]  Genital HPV is spread by sustained  direct skin-to-skin  contact,  with  vaginal,  anal,  and  oral  sex  being  the  most  common methods. [4][21]   Occasionally,  it  can  spread  from  manual  sex  or  from  a  mother  to  her  baby  during pregnancy. [99][100]   HPV  is  difficult  to  remove  via  standard  hospital  disinfection  techniques  and  may  be transmitted  in  a  healthcare  setting  on  re-usable  gynecological  equipment,  such  as  vaginal  ultrasound transducers. The period of communicability is still unknown, but likely at least as long as visible HPV lesions persist. HPV may still be transmitted even after lesions are treated and no longer visible or present. [101]\n\n\n# Perinatal\n\nAlthough genital HPV types can be transmitted from mother to child during birth, the appearance of genital HPV-related diseases in newborns is rare. However, the lack of appearance does not rule out asymptomatic latent infection, as the virus has proven to be capable of hiding for decades. Perinatal transmission of HPV types 6 and 11 can result in the development of juvenile-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (JORRP). JORRP  is  very  rare,  with  rates  of  about  2  cases  per  100,000  children  in  the  United  States. [41]   Although JORRP rates are substantially higher if a woman presents with genital warts at the time of giving birth, the risk of JORRP in such cases is still less than 1%. [102]\n\n\n## Genital infections\n\nGenital HPV infections are transmitted primarily by contact with the genitals, anus, or mouth of an infected sexual partner. [103]\n\nOf  the  120  known  human  papillomaviruses,  51  species  and  three  subtypes  infect  the  genital  mucosa. [104] Fifteen are classified as high-risk types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68, 73, and 82), three as probable high-risk (26, 53, and 66), and twelve as low-risk (6, 11, 40, 42, 43, 44, 54, 61, 70, 72, 81, and 89). [20]\n\nCondoms do not completely protect from the virus because the areas around the genitals, including the inner thigh area, are not covered, thus exposing these areas to the infected person's skin. [105][106]\n\n\n## Hands\n\nStudies  have  shown  HPV  transmission  between  the  hands  and  genitals  of  the  same  person  and  sexual partners. Hernandez tested the genitals and dominant hand of each person in 25 heterosexual couples every other month for an average of seven months. She found two couples where the man's genitals infected the woman's hand with high-risk HPV, two where her hand infected his genitals, one where her genitals infected his hand, two each where he infected his own hand, and she infected her own hand. Hands were not the main source of transmission in these 25 couples, but they were significant. [107]\n\nPartridge reports men's fingertips became positive for high-risk HPV at more than half the rate (26% per two years) as their genitals (48%). [108]  Winer reports 14% of fingertip samples from sexually active women were positive. [109]\n\nNon-sexual  hand  contact  seems  to  have  little  or  no  role  in  HPV  transmission.  Winer  found  all  fourteen fingertip samples from virgin women negative at the start of her fingertip study. [109]  In a separate report on genital HPV infection, 1% of virgin women (1 of 76) with no sexual contact tested positive for HPV, while 10% of virgin women reporting non-penetrative sexual contact were positive (7 of 72). [110]\n\n\n## Shared objects\n\nSharing of possibly contaminated objects, for example, razors, [101]  may transmit HPV. [111][112][113]  Although possible,  transmission  by  routes  other  than  sexual  intercourse  is  less  common  for  female  genital  HPV infection. [103]   Fingers-genital  contact  is  a  possible  way  of  transmission,  but  unlikely  to  be  a  significant source. [109][114]"

        "text": "# Blood\n\nThough it has traditionally been assumed that HPV is not transmissible via blood, as it is thought to infect only cutaneous and mucosal tissues, recent studies have called this notion into question. Historically, HPV DNA has been detected in the blood of cervical cancer patients. [115]  In 2005, a group reported that, in frozen blood samples of 57 sexually naive pediatric patients who had vertical or transfusion-acquired HIV infection, 8 (14.0%) of these samples also tested positive for HPV-16. [116]  This seems to indicate that it may be possible for HPV to be transmitted via blood transfusion. However, as non-sexual transmission of HPV by other means is not uncommon, this could not be definitively proven. In 2009, a group tested Australian Red Cross blood samples from 180 healthy male donors for HPV, and subsequently found DNA of one or more strains of the virus in 15 (8.3%) of the samples. [117]  However, it is important to note that detecting the presence of HPV DNA in blood is not the same as detecting the virus itself in blood, and whether or not the virus itself can or does reside in blood in infected individuals is still unknown. As such, it remains to be determined whether HPV can or cannot be  transmitted  via  blood. [115]   This  is  of  concern,  as  blood  donations  are  not  currently screened  for  HPV,  and  at  least  some  organizations,  such  as  the  American  Red  Cross  and  other  Red  Cross societies, do not presently appear to disallow HPV-positive individuals from donating blood. [118]\n\n\n## Surgery\n\nHospital  transmission  of  HPV,  especially  to  surgical  staff,  has  been  documented.  Surgeons,  including urologists and/or anyone in the room, are subject to HPV infection by inhalation of noxious viral particles during  electrocautery  or  laser  ablation  of  a  condyloma  (wart). [119]   There  has  been  a  case  report  of  a  laser surgeon  who  developed  extensive  laryngeal  papillomatosis  after  providing  laser  ablation  to  patients  with anogenital condylomata. [119]\n\n\n## Virology\n\nHPV infection is limited to the basal cells of stratified epithelium, the only tissue in which they replicate. [121]  The virus cannot bind to live tissue; instead, it infects epithelial tissues through micro-abrasions or other  epithelial  trauma  that  exposes  segments  of  the  basement membrane. [121]  The infectious process is slow, taking 12-24 hours for initiation  of  transcription.  It  is  believed  that  the  involved  antibodies play  a  major  neutralizing  role  while  the  virions  still  reside  on  the basement membrane and cell surfaces. [121]\n\nHPV  lesions  are  thought  to  arise  from  the  proliferation  of  infected basal keratinocytes. Infection typically occurs when basal cells in the host are exposed to the infectious virus through a disturbed epithelial barrier, as would occur during sexual intercourse or after minor skin abrasions. HPV infections are not cytolytic; rather, viral particles are released  as  a  result  of  the  degeneration  of  desquamating  cells.  HPV\n\ncan survive for many months and at low temperatures without a host; therefore, an individual with plantar warts can spread the virus by walking barefoot. [39]\n\nHPV is a small double-stranded circular DNA virus with a genome of approximately 8000 base pairs. [21][122] The HPV life cycle strictly follows the differentiation program of the host keratinocyte. It is thought that the HPV virion  infects  epithelial  tissues  through  micro-abrasions,  whereby  the  virion  associates  with  putative receptors such as alpha integrins, laminins, and annexin A2 [123]  leading to the entry of the virions into basal epithelial  cells  through  clathrin-mediated  endocytosis  and/or  caveolin-mediated  endocytosis  depending  on the type of HPV. [124]  At this point, the viral genome is transported to the nucleus by unknown mechanisms and  establishes  itself  at  a  copy  number  of  10-200  viral  genomes  per  cell.  A  sophisticated  transcriptional cascade then occurs as the host keratinocyte begins to divide and become increasingly differentiated in the upper layers of the epithelium."

        "text": "# Evolution\n\nThe phylogeny of the various strains of HPV generally reflects the migration patterns of Homo sapiens and suggests that HPV may have diversified along with the human population. Studies suggest that HPV evolved along  five  major  branches  that  reflect  the  ethnicity  of  human  hosts,  and  diversified  along  with  the  human population. [125]\n\nResearchers  initially  identified  two  major  variants  of  HPV16,  European  (HPV16-E),  and  Non-European (HPV16-NE). [126]  More recent analyses based on thousands of HPV16 genomes show that indeed two major clades exist, that are further subdivided into four lineages (designated A-D) and even further subdivided into 16 sublineages (A1-4, B1-4, C1-4 and D1-4). [127][128]  The A1-A3 sublineages constitute the European variant, A4  the  Asian  variant,  B1-B4  the  African  type  I  variant,  C1-C4  the  African  type  II  variant,  D1  the  North American  variant,  D2  the  Asian  American  type  I  variant,  D3  the  Asian  American  type  II  variant. [127]   The various lineages and sublineages have different oncogenic capacity, where overall, the non-European lineages are  considered  to  increase  the  risk  for  cancer. [129]   Although  HPV16  is  a  DNA  virus,  there  are  signs  of recombination  among  the  different  lineages. [128][130]   Based  on  an  analysis  of  more  than  3600  genomes, between  0.3  and  1.2%  of  them  could  be  recombinant. [128]   Thus,  ideally,  genotyping  (for  cancer-risk assessment) of HPV16 should not be based only on certain genes, but on all genes from the entire genome. [128]\n\nA bioinformatics tool named HPV16-Genotyper performs i) HPV16 lineage genotyping, ii) detects potential recombination  events,  iii)  identifies,  within  the  submitted  sequences,  mutations/SNPs  that  have  been reported (in literature) to increase the risk for cancer. [128]\n\n\n## E6/E7 proteins\n\nThe two primary oncoproteins of high-risk HPV types are E6 and E7. The  \"E\"  designation  indicates  that  these  two  proteins  are  early proteins (expressed early in the HPV life cycle). The \"L\" designation indicates  that  they  are  late  proteins  (late  expression). [59]   The  HPV genome is composed of six early (E1, E2, E4, E5, E6, and E7) open reading frames (ORF), two late (L1 and L2) ORFs, and a non-coding long control region (LCR). [132]  After the host cell is infected viral early promoter is activated. A polycistronic primary RNA containing all six early  ORFs  is  transcribed.  This  polycistronic  RNA  then  undergoes active RNA splicing to generate multiple isoforms of mRNAs. [133]  One of the spliced isoform RNAs, E6*I, serves as an E7 mRNA to translate E7 protein. [134]  However, viral early transcription subjects to viral E2 regulation and high E2 levels repress the transcription. HPV genomes integrate into the host  genome  by  disruption  of  the  E2  ORF, preventing E2 repression of E6 and E7. Thus, viral genome integration into the host DNA genome increases E6 and E7 expression to promote\n\ncellular proliferation and the chance of malignancy. The degree to which E6 and E7 are expressed is correlated with the type of cervical lesion that can ultimately develop. [122]\n\n\n## Role in cancer\n\nSometimes  papillomavirus  genomes  are  found  integrated  into  the  host  genome,  and  this  is  especially noticeable  with  oncogenic  HPVs. [135]   The  E6/E7  proteins  inactivate  two  tumor  suppressor  proteins,  p53 (inactivated by E6) and pRb (inactivated by E7). [136]  The viral oncogenes E6 and E7 [137]  are thought to modify the  cell  cycle  so  as  to  retain  the  differentiating  host  keratinocyte  in  a  state  that  is  favourable  to  the amplification of viral genome replication and consequent late gene expression. E6, in association with the host E6-associated protein, which has ubiquitin ligase activity, acts to ubiquitinate p53, leading to its proteosomal degradation. E7 (in oncogenic HPVs)  acts as the primary transforming protein. E7 competes for retinoblastoma protein (pRb) binding, freeing the transcription factor E2F to transactivate its targets, thus pushing the cell cycle forward. All HPV strains can induce transient proliferation, but only strains 16 and 18 can immortalize cell lines in vitro . It has also been shown that HPV 16 and 18 cannot immortalize primary rat cells alone; there needs to be activation of the ras oncogene. In the upper layers of the host epithelium, the late genes L1 and L2 are transcribed/translated and serve as structural proteins that encapsidate the amplified viral  genomes.  Once  the  genome  is  encapsidated,  the  capsid  appears  to  undergo  a  redox-dependent assembly/maturation event, which is tied to a natural redox gradient that spans both suprabasal and cornified epithelial  tissue  layers.  This  assembly/maturation  event  stabilizes  virions  and  increases  their  specific infectivity. [138]   Virions  can  then  be  sloughed  off  in  the  dead  squames  of  the  host  epithelium  and  the  viral lifecycle  continues. [139]   A  2010  study  has  found  that  E6  and  E7  are  involved  in  beta-catenin  nuclear accumulation and activation of Wnt signaling in HPV-induced cancers. [140]"

        "text": "# Latency period\n\nOnce  an  HPV  virion  invades  a  cell,  an  active  infection  occurs,  and  the  virus  can  be  transmitted.  Several months  to  years  may  elapse  before  squamous  intraepithelial  lesions  (SIL)  develop  and  can  be  clinically detected. The  time from  active infection to clinically detectable disease may  make  it difficult for epidemiologists to establish which partner was the source of infection. [119]\n\n\n## Clearance\n\nMost people clear HPV infections without medical action or consequences. The table provides data for highrisk types (i.e., the types found in cancers). [141]\n\n\n| Months after initial positive test   | 8 months   | 12 months   | 18 months   |\n|--------------------------------------|------------|-------------|-------------|\n| % of men tested negative             | 70%        | 80%         | 100%        |\n\n\nClearing  an  infection  does  not  always  create  immunity  if  there  is  a  new  or  continuing  source  of  infection. Hernandez's 2005-6 study of 25 couples reports \"A number of instances indicated apparent reinfection [from partner] after viral clearance.\" [107]\n\n\n## Diagnosis\n\nResearchers have identified over 200 types of HPV, and classify them by numbers. [11][7][136]  They may be divided into \"low-risk\" and \"highrisk\" types. Low-risk types cause warts, and high-risk types can cause lesions or cancer. [143][144]\n\n\n## Cervical testing\n\nGuidelines  from  the  American  Cancer  Society  recommend  different screening  strategies  for  cervical  cancer  based  on  a  woman's  age, screening history, risk factors, and choice of tests. [145]  Because of the link between HPV and cervical cancer, the ACS currently recommends early detection of cervical cancer in average-risk asymptomatic adults primarily  with  cervical  cytology  by  Pap  smear,  regardless  of  HPV\n\nvaccination status. Women aged 30-65 should preferably be tested every 5 years with both the HPV test and the Pap test. In other age groups, a Pap test alone can suffice unless they have been diagnosed with atypical squamous  cells  of  undetermined  significance  (ASC-US). [146]   Co-testing  with  a  Pap  test  and  HPV  test  is recommended because it decreases  the  rate  of  false-negatives.  According  to  the  National  Cancer  Institute, \"The most common test detects DNA from several high-risk HPV types, but it cannot identify the types that are present. Another test is specific for DNA from HPV types 16 and 18, the two types that cause most HPVassociated cancers. A third test can detect DNA from several high-risk HPV types and can indicate whether HPV-16 or HPV-18 is present. A fourth test detects RNA from the most common high-risk HPV types. These tests can detect HPV infections before cell abnormalities are evident."

        "text": "\"Theoretically, the HPV DNA and RNA tests could be used to identify HPV infections in cells taken from any part of the body. However, the tests are approved by the FDA for only two indications: for follow-up testing of women who seem to have abnormal Pap test results and for cervical cancer screening in combination with a Pap test among women over age 30.\" [147]\n\n\n# Mouth testing\n\nGuidelines for oropharyngeal cancer screening by the Preventive Services Task Force and American Dental Association in the U.S. suggest conventional visual examination. Since some parts of the oropharynx are hard to see, this cancer is often only detected in later stages. [77]\n\nThe  diagnosis  of  oropharyngeal  cancer  is  made  using  a  biopsy  of  exfoliated  cells  or  tissues.  The  National Comprehensive  Cancer  Network  and  College  of  American  Pathologists  recommend  testing  for  HPV  in oropharyngeal cancer. [77]  The FDA in the United States does not recommend a specific type of test to detect HPV  from  oral  tumors,  even  though  they  recommend  HPV  testing  of  people  with  oropharyngeal  cancer. Because HPV type 16 is the most common type found in oropharyngeal cancer, p16 immunohistochemistry is one test option used to determine if HPV is present, [148]  which can help determine course of treatment since tumors that are negative for p16 have worse outcomes. Another option that has emerged as a reliable option is HPV DNA in situ hybridization (ISH), which allows for visualization of the HPV. [77]\n\n\n## Testing men\n\nThere is not a wide range of tests available, even though HPV is common; most studies of HPV used tools and custom analysis not available to the general public. [149]  Clinicians often depend on the vaccine among young people  and  high  clearance  rates  (see  Clearance  subsection  in  Virology)  to  create  a  low  risk  of  disease  and mortality, and treat the cancers when they appear. Others believe that reducing HPV infection in more men and women, even when it has no symptoms, is important (herd immunity) to prevent more cancers rather than just treating them. [150][151]  Where tests are used, negative test results show safety from transmission, and positive  test  results  show  where  shielding  (condoms,  gloves)  is  needed  to  prevent  transmission  until  the infection clears. [152]\n\nStudies have tested for and found HPV in men, including high-risk types (i.e., the types found in cancers), on fingers, mouth, saliva, anus, urethra, urine, semen, blood, scrotum, and penis. [149]\n\nThe  aforementioned  Qiagen/Digene  kit  was  successfully  used  off-label  to  test  the  penis,  scrotum,  and anus [153]  of men in long-term relationships with women who were positive for high-risk HPV. Of these men, 60% were found to carry the virus, primarily on the penis. [153]  Similar studies have been conducted on women using cytobrushes - an endocervical brush for sampling the cervix in females - and custom analysis. [154][155]\n\nIn  one  study,  researchers  sampled  subjects'  urethra,  scrotum,  and  penis. [154][155]   Samples  taken  from  the urethra added less than 1% to the HPV rate. Studies like this led Giuliano to recommend sampling the glans, shaft, and crease between them, along with the scrotum, since sampling the urethra or anus added very little to the diagnosis. [108]  Dunne recommends the glans, shaft, their crease, and the foreskin. [149]\n\nIn one study, the subjects were asked not to wash their genitals for 12 hours before sampling, including the urethra as well as the scrotum and the penis. [154]  Other studies are silent on washing - a particular gap in studies of the hands.\n\nOne small study used wet cytobrushes, rather than wetting the skin. [155]  It found a higher proportion of men to  be  HPV-positive when the skin was rubbed with a 600-grit emery paper before being swabbed with the brush, rather than swabbed with no preparation. It's unclear whether the emery paper collected the virions or loosened them for the swab to collect.\n\nStudies have found self-collection (with emery paper and Dacron swabs) as effective as collection done by a clinician, and sometimes more so, since patients were more willing than a clinician to scrape vigorously. [156][157]   Women  had  similar  success  in  self-sampling  using  tampons,  swabs,  cytobrushes,  and"

        "text": "# lavage. [158]\n\nSeveral studies used cytobrushes to sample fingertips and under fingernails, without wetting the area or the brush. [109][114][159]\n\nOther studies analyzed urine, semen, and blood and found varying amounts of HPV, [149]  but there is not a publicly available test for those yet.\n\n\n## Other testing\n\nAlthough it is possible to test for HPV DNA in other kinds of infections, [149]  there are no FDA-approved tests for general screening in the United States [160]  or tests approved by the Canadian government, [161]  since the testing is inconclusive and considered medically unnecessary. [162]\n\nGenital warts are the only visible sign of low-risk genital HPV and can be identified with a visual check. These visible growths, however, are the result of non-carcinogenic HPV types. Five percent acetic acid (vinegar) is used  to  identify  both  warts  and  squamous  intraepithelial  neoplasia  (SIL)  lesions  with  limited  success  by causing abnormal tissue to appear white, but most doctors have found this technique helpful only in moist areas, such as the female genital tract. At this time, HPV tests for males are used only in research.\n\nResearch into testing for HPV by antibody presence has been done. The approach is looking for an immune response in blood, which would contain antibodies for HPV if the patient is HPV positive. [163][164][165][166]  The reliability  of  such  tests  has  not  been  proven,  as  there  has  not  been  a  FDA  approved  product  as  of  August 2018; [167]  testing by blood would be a less invasive test for screening purposes.\n\n\n## Prevention\n\nHPV vaccines can prevent high-risk types of infection. [4]  HPV testing can be completed to identify people who carry  high-risk  HPV  strains,  who  may  go  on  to  develop  cancer. [168]   Cervical  cancer  screening  with  the Papanicolaou test or looking at the cervix after using acetic acid, can detect abnormal cells that may go on to develop  into  cancer  or  early  cancer. [1]   Screening  has  reduced  both  the  number  of  cases  and  deaths  from cervical cancer in the developed world. [169]  Warts can be removed by freezing. [5]\n\n\n## Vaccines\n\nHPV vaccines  protect  against  either  two,  four,  or  nine  types  of  HPV. [170]   There  are  six  prophylactic  HPV vaccines licensed for use: the bivalent vaccines Cervarix , Cecolin ,  and Walrinvax ; the quadrivalent vaccines Cervavax and Gardasil ; and the nonavalent vaccine Gardasil 9 . All HPV vaccines protect against HPV types 16 and 18, which cause the greatest risk of cervical cancer. The quadrivalent vaccines also protect against HPV types 6 and 11. The nonavalent vaccine Gardasil 9 protects against those four types (6, 11, 16 and 18), along with  five  other  high-risk  HPV  types  responsible  for  20%  of  cervical  cancers  (types  31,  33,  45,  52,  and 58). [170][171]\n\nThe vaccines provide little benefit to women already infected with HPV types 16 and 18. [172]  For this reason, the vaccine is recommended primarily for those women not yet having been exposed to HPV during sex. The World  Health  Organization  position  paper  on  HPV  vaccination  clearly  outlines  appropriate,  cost-effective strategies for using the HPV vaccine in public sector programs. [173]\n\nTo be most effective, vaccination should occur before the onset of sexual activity and is recommended between the ages of 9-13 years. [1]  For children between the ages of 9-14 years, vaccination effectiveness is reported to range between 74% and 93%, decreasing to 12% to 90% for 15-18 year old adolescents. [174]\n\nThere  is  high-certainty  evidence  that  HPV  vaccines  protect  against  precancerous  cervical  lesions  in  young women,  particularly  those  vaccinated  aged  15  to  26. [175]   HPV  vaccines  do  not  increase  the  risk  of  serious adverse events. [175]  Longer follow-up is needed to monitor the impact of HPV vaccines on cervical cancer. [175]"

        "text": "The CDC recommends the vaccines be delivered in two shots at an interval of at least 6 months for those aged 11-12, and three doses for those 13 and older. [176]  In most countries, they are funded only for female use. They are approved for male use in many countries and funded for teenage boys in Australia. The vaccine does not have any therapeutic effect on existing HPV infections or cervical lesions. [177]\n\nFollowing studies suggesting that the vaccine is more effective in younger girls than in older teenagers, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Quebec began offering the vaccine in a two-dose schedule for girls aged under 15 in 2014. [178]\n\nCervical cancer screening recommendations have not changed for females who receive the HPV vaccine. It remains a recommendation that women continue cervical screening, such as Pap smear testing, even after receiving the vaccine, since it does not prevent all types of cervical cancer. [177][179]\n\nBoth men and women are carriers of HPV. [180]  The Gardasil vaccine also protects men against anal cancers and warts and genital warts. [181]\n\nThe duration of both vaccines' efficacy has been observed since they were first developed, and is expected to be long-lasting. [182]\n\nIn  December  2014,  the  FDA  approved  a  nine-valent  Gardasil-based  vaccine,  Gardasil  9,  to  protect  against infection with the four strains of HPV covered by the first generation of Gardasil as well as five other strains responsible for 20% of cervical cancers (HPV-31, HPV-33, HPV-45, HPV-52, and HPV-58). [183]\n\n\n## Condoms\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that male \"condom use may reduce the risk for genital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection\" but provides a lesser degree of protection compared with other sexual transmitted  infections  \"because  HPV  also  may  be  transmitted  by  exposure  to  areas  (e.g.,  infected  skin  or mucosal surfaces) that are not covered or protected by the condom.\" [184]\n\n\n## Disinfection\n\nThe virus is unusually hardy and is immune to most common disinfectants. It is the first virus ever shown to be resistant to inactivation by glutaraldehyde, which is among the most common strong disinfectants used in hospitals. [185]   Diluted sodium hypochlorite bleach is effective, [185]  but cannot be used on some types of reusable  equipment,  such  as  ultrasound  transducers. [99]   As  a  result  of  these  difficulties,  there  is  developing concern  about  the  possibility  of  transmitting  the  virus  on  healthcare  equipment,  particularly  reusable gynecological  equipment  that  cannot  be  autoclaved. [186][187]   For  such  equipment,  some  health  authorities encourage use of UV disinfection [188]  or a non-hypochlorite \"oxidizing -based high -level disinfectant [bleach] with  label  claims  for  non -enveloped  viruses\", [189]   such  as  a  strong  hydrogen  peroxide  solution [190][188]   or chlorine dioxide wipes. [188]\n\n\n## Management\n\nThere is currently no specific treatment for HPV infection. [191][192][193]  However, the viral infection is usually cleared to undetectable levels by the immune system. [194]  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the body's immune system clears HPV naturally within two years for 90% of cases (see Clearance subsection in Virology for more detail). [191]  However, experts disagree on whether the virus is eliminated or reduced to undetectable levels, and it is difficult to know when it is contagious. [195]\n\nFollow-up care is usually recommended and practiced by many health clinics. [196]  Follow-up is sometimes not successful because a portion of those treated do not return to be evaluated. In addition to the normal methods of phone calls and mail, text messaging and email can improve the number of people who return for care. [197] As  of  2015  it  is  unclear  the  best  method  of  follow  up  following  treatment  of  cervical  intraepithelial neoplasia. [198]"

        "text": "# Epidemiology\n\nGlobally, 12% of women are positive for HPV DNA, with rates varying by age and country. [199]  The highest rates of HPV are in younger women, with a rate of 24% in women under 25 years. [200]  Rates decline in older age groups in Europe and the Americas, but less so in Africa and Asia. The rates are highest in Sub-Saharan Africa (24%) and Eastern Europe (21%) and lowest in North America (5%) and Western Asia (2%). [199]\n\nThe most common types of HPV worldwide are HPV16 (3.2%), HPV18 (1.4%), HPV52 (0.9%), HPV31 (0.8%), and HPV58 (0.7%). High-risk types of HPV are also distributed unevenly, with HPV16 having a rate of around 13% in Africa and 30% in West and Central Asia. [200]\n\nLike many diseases, HPV disproportionately affects low-income and resource-poor countries. The higher rates of  HPV in Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, may be related to high exposure to human immunodeficiency virus  (HIV)  in  the  region.  Other  factors  that  impact  the  global  spread  of  the  disease  are  sexual  behavior, including age of sexual debut and number of sexual partners, and ease of access to barrier contraception, all of which vary globally. [199][201]\n\nThe papilloma virus is not only widespread among women, but is also behind most cases of oropharyngeal cancer, which is the fastest growing cancer among young adults in Western countries. [202]  Moreover, as of 2025, papillomavirus is the most prevalent sexually transmitted infection in the world. [202]\n\n\n## United States\n\nHPV is estimated to be the most common sexually transmitted infection in the  United  States. [203]   Most  sexually  active  men  and  women  will  probably acquire genital HPV infection at some point in their lives. [23]  The American Social  Health  Association  estimates  that  about  75-80%  of  sexually  active Americans will be infected with HPV at some point in their lifetime. [204][205] By the age of 50 more than 80% of American women will have contracted at least  one  strain  of  genital  HPV. [203][206]   It  was  estimated  that,  in  the  year 2000,  there  were  approximately  6.2  million  new  HPV  infections  among Americans  aged  15-44;  of  these,  an  estimated  74%  occurred  to  people between  ages  of  15  and  24. [207]   Of  the  STIs  studied,  genital  HPV  was  the most commonly acquired. [207]  In the United States, it is estimated that 10% of the population has an active HPV infection, 4% has an infection that has caused  cytological  abnormalities,  and  an  additional  1%  has  an  infection causing genital warts. [208]\n\n\n| Age (years)   | Prevalence (%)   |\n|---------------|------------------|\n| 14 to 19      | 24.5%            |\n| 20 to 24      | 44.8%            |\n| 25 to 29      | 27.4%            |\n| 30 to 39      | 27.5%            |\n| 40 to 49      | 25.2%            |\n| 50 to 59      | 19.6%            |\n| 14 to 59      | 26.8%            |\n\n\nEstimates  of  HPV  prevalence  vary  from  14%  to  more  than  90%. [209]   One reason for the difference is that some studies report women who currently have a detectable infection, while other studies report women who have ever had a detectable infection. [210][211]  Another cause of discrepancy is the difference in strains that were tested for.\n\nOne study found that, in the US, during 2003-2004, at any given time, 26.8% of women aged 14 to 59 were infected with at least one type of HPV. This was higher than previous estimates; 15.2% were infected with one or more of the high-risk types that can cause cancer. [203][212]\n\nThe prevalence of high-risk and low-risk types is roughly similar over time. [203]\n\nHuman papillomavirus  is  not  included  among  the  diseases  that  are  typically  reportable  to  the  CDC  as  of 2011. [213][214]"

        "text": "# Ireland\n\nOn average, 538 cases of HPV-associated cancers were diagnosed per year in Ireland during the period 2010 to 2014. [215]  Cervical cancer was the most frequent HPV-associated cancer with on average 292 cases per year (74% of the female total, and 54% of the overall total of HPV-associated cancers). [215]  A study of 996 cervical cytology  samples  in  an  Irish  urban  female,  opportunistically  screened  population,  found  an  overall  HPV prevalence of 19.8%, HPV 16 at 20% and HPV 18 at 12% were the commonest high-risk types detected. In Europe, types 16 and 18 are responsible for over 70% of cervical cancers. [216]  Overall rates of HPV-associated invasive  cancers  may  be  increasing.  Between  1994  and  2014,  there  was  a  2%  increase  in  the  rate  of  HPVassociated invasive cancers per year for both sexes in Ireland. [215]\n\nAs  HPV  is  known  to  be  associated  with  anogenital  warts,  these  are  notifiable  to  the  Health  Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC). Genital warts are the second most common STI in Ireland. [217]  There were 1,281 cases of anogenital warts notified in 2017, which was a decrease on the 2016 figure of 1,593. [218]  The highest age-specific rate for both male and female was in the 25-29 year old age range; 53% of cases were among males. [218]\n\n\n## Sri Lanka\n\nIn Sri Lanka, the prevalence of HPV is 15.5% regardless of cytological abnormalities. [219]\n\n\n## Inner Mongolia\n\nIn the Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia, overall HPV prevalence is 14.5% but shows substantial ethnical disparity,  the  prevalence  in  Mongolian  women  (14.9%)  being  much  higher  than  that  of  Han  participants (4.3%). [220]   Urbanization,  the  number  of  sex  partners,  and  PAP  history  appear  as  risk  factors  for  HPV infection  in  Han,  but  not  in  Mongolian  women.  The  region  is  thus  an  important  example  that  the epidemiology of HPV is more related to cultural and ethnical factors and not to geography per se.\n\n\n## History\n\nOne  of  the  first  studies  linking  the  risk  of  uterine  carcinoma  with  the  number  of  sexual  activities  was performed  in  1842,  in  Verona.  Dr.  Domenico  Rigoni-Stern  observed  that  uterine  cancer  incidence  among Catholic  nuns  living  in  convents  in  the  countryside  was  lower  than  in  women  living  in  the  city.  Highest incidence was seen for prostitutes, thereby linking uterine cancer prevalence to the number of sexual partners, and suggesting that this disease might have a sexually transmissible component. [221]\n\nIn 1972, the association of the human papillomaviruses with skin cancer in epidermodysplasia verruciformis was proposed by Stefania Jabłońska in Poland. In 1976, Harald zur Hausen published the hypothesis that human papillomavirus plays an important role in the cause of cervical cancer. In 1978, Jabłońska and Gérard Orth  at  the  Pasteur  Institute  discovered  HPV-5  in  skin  cancer. [222]   In  1983  and  1984  zur  Hausen  and  his collaborators identified HPV16 and HPV18 in cervical cancer. [223]\n\nThe HeLa cell line contains extra DNA in its genome that originated from HPV type 18. [224]\n\n\n## Research\n\nThe  Ludwig-McGill  HPV  Cohort  is  one  of  the  world's  largest  longitudinal  studies  of  the  natural  history  of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical cancer risk. It was established in 1993 by Ludwig Cancer Research and McGill University in Montreal, Canada. [225]"
