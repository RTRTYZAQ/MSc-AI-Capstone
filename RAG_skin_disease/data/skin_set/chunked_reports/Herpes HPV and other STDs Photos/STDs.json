        "text": "# Sexually transmitted infection\n\nA sexually transmitted infection ( STI ), also referred to as a sexually  transmitted  disease ( STD )  and  the  older  term venereal disease ( VD ), is an infection that is spread by sexual activity,  especially  vaginal  intercourse,  anal  sex,  oral  sex,  or sometimes manual sex. [1][5][6]  STIs often do not initially cause symptoms, [1]   which  results  in  a  risk  of  transmitting  them  to others. [7][8]  The term sexually transmitted infection is generally preferred over sexually transmitted disease or venereal disease , as it includes cases with no symptomatic disease. [9]  Symptoms and signs of STIs may  include vaginal discharge, penile discharge, ulcers on or around the genitals, and pelvic pain. [1] Some STIs can cause infertility. [1]",

[1]   Some vaccinations may decrease the risk of certain infections including  hepatitis  B  and  a  few  types  of  HPV. [2]   Safe  sex practices such as the use of condoms, having smaller number of sexual  partners,  and  being  in  a  relationship  in  which  each person only has sex with the other also decreases STIs risk.

HSV1 is typically acquired orally and causes cold sores; HSV-2 is usually acquired during sexual contact and affects the genitals; however, either strain may affect either site. [ 60 ]  Some people are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms. Those that do experience symptoms usually notice them 2 to 20 days after exposure which lasts 2 to 4 weeks. Symptoms can include small fluid-filled blisters, headaches, backaches, itching or tingling sensations in the genital or anal area, pain during urination, fl u like symptoms, swollen glands, or fever. Herpes is spread through skin contact with a person infected with the virus. The virus affects the areas where it entered the body. This can occur through kissing, vaginal intercourse, oral sex or anal sex. The virus is most infectious during times when there are visible symptoms; however, those who are asymptomatic can still spread the virus through skin contact. [ 61 ] The initial infection and symptoms are usually the most severe because the body does not have any antibodies built up. After the primary attack, one might have recurring attacks that are milder or might not even have future attacks.

With the discovery of antibiotics, a large number of sexually transmitted infections became easily curable, and this, combined with effective public health campaigns against STIs, led to a public perception during the 1960s and 1970s that they have ceased to be a serious medical threat.\n\nDuring this period, the importance of contact tracing in treating STIs was recognized. By tracing the sexual partners of infected individuals, testing them for infection, treating the infected and tracing their contacts, in turn, STI clinics could effectively suppress infections in the general population.",

AIDS,  in  particular,  has  a  long asymptomatic period-during which time HIV (the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS) can replicate and the disease can be transmitted to others-followed by a symptomatic period, which leads rapidly to death unless treated. HIV/AIDS entered the United States from Haiti in about 1969. [121]  Recognition that AIDS threatened a global pandemic led to public information campaigns and the development of treatments that allow AIDS to be managed by suppressing the replication of HIV for as long as possible. Contact tracing continues to be an important measure, even when diseases are incurable, as it helps to contain infection.\n\n\n## See also\n\n\n- List of sexually transmitted infections by prevalence",

        "text": "# Sexually transmitted infection\n\nA sexually transmitted infection ( STI ), also referred to as a sexually  transmitted  disease ( STD )  and  the  older  term venereal disease ( VD ), is an infection that is spread by sexual activity,  especially  vaginal  intercourse,  anal  sex,  oral  sex,  or sometimes manual sex. [1][5][6]  STIs often do not initially cause symptoms, [1]   which  results  in  a  risk  of  transmitting  them  to others. [7][8]  The term sexually transmitted infection is generally preferred over sexually transmitted disease or venereal disease , as it includes cases with no symptomatic disease. [9]  Symptoms and signs of STIs may  include vaginal discharge, penile discharge, ulcers on or around the genitals, and pelvic pain. [1] Some STIs can cause infertility. [1]\n\nBacterial  STIs  include  chlamydia,  gonorrhea,  and  syphilis. [1] Viral STIs include genital warts, genital herpes, and HIV/AIDS. [1] Parasitic  STIs  include  trichomoniasis. [1]   Most STIs are treatable and curable; of the most common infections, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis are curable, while  HIV/AIDS  and  genital  herpes  are  not  curable. [1]   Some vaccinations may decrease the risk of certain infections including  hepatitis  B  and  a  few  types  of  HPV. [2]   Safe  sex practices such as the use of condoms, having smaller number of sexual  partners,  and  being  in  a  relationship  in  which  each person only has sex with the other also decreases STIs risk. [1][2] Comprehensive sex education may also be useful. [10]\n\nSTI diagnostic tests are usually easily available in the developed world, but they are often unavailable in the developing world. [1] There  is  often  shame  and  stigma  associated  with  STIs. [1]   In 2015, STIs other than HIV resulted in 108,000 deaths worldwide. [4]   Globally,  in  2015,  about  1.1  billion  people  had STIs  other  than  HIV/AIDS. [3]   About  500  million  have  either syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia or trichomoniasis. [1]  At least an additional  530  million  have  genital  herpes,  and  290  million women have human papillomavirus. [1] Historical documentation  of  STIs  in  antiquity  dates  back  to  at  least  the\n\n\n## Sexually transmitted infection\n\nOther names\n\nSexually transmitted disease (STD);\n\nVenereal disease (VD)\n\nSpecialty Symptoms\n\nInfectious disease\n\nNone, vaginal discharge, penile discharge, ulcers on or around the genitals, pelvic pain [ 1 ]\n\nComplications\n\nInfertility [ 1 ]\n\nCauses\n\nInfections commonly spread by sex [1]\n\nPrevention\n\nSexual abstinence,\n\nvaccinations, condoms [2]\n\nFrequency\n\n1.1 billion (STIs other than\n\nHIV/AIDS, 2015) [3]\n\nDeaths\n\n108,000 (STIs other than HIV/AIDS, 2015) [4]\n\nEbers Papyrus (c. 1550 BCE) and the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament (8th/7th C.

In women, symptoms may include abnormal vaginal discharge, burning during urination, and bleeding in between periods, although most women do not experience any symptoms. [58]  Symptoms in men include pain when urinating, and abnormal discharge from their penis. [ 59 ] If left untreated in both men and women, chlamydia can infect the urinary tract and potentially lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID can cause serious problems during pregnancy and even has the potential to cause infertility. It can cause a woman to have a potentially deadly ectopic pregnancy, in which the egg implants outside of the uterus. However, chlamydia can be cured with antibiotics.\n- The two most common forms of herpes are caused by infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV1 is typically acquired orally and causes cold sores; HSV-2 is usually acquired during sexual contact and affects the genitals; however, either strain may affect either site. [ 60 ]  Some people are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms. Those that do experience symptoms usually notice them 2 to 20 days after exposure which lasts 2 to 4 weeks. Symptoms can include small fluid-filled blisters, headaches, backaches, itching or tingling sensations in the genital or anal area, pain during urination, fl u like symptoms, swollen glands, or fever. Herpes is spread through skin contact with a person infected with the virus. The virus affects the areas where it entered the body. This can occur through kissing, vaginal intercourse, oral sex or anal sex. The virus is most infectious during times when there are visible symptoms; however, those who are asymptomatic can still spread the virus through skin contact. [ 61 ] The initial infection and symptoms are usually the most severe because the body does not have any antibodies built up. After the primary attack, one might have recurring attacks that are milder or might not even have future attacks. There is no cure for the disease but there are antiviral medications that treat its symptoms and lower the risk of transmission (Valtrex). Although HSV-1 is typically the \"oral\" version of the virus, and HSV-2 is typically the \"genital\" version of the virus, a person with HSV-1 orally can transmit that virus to their partner genitally. The virus, either type, will settle into a nerve bundle either at the top of the spine, producing the \"oral\" outbreak, or a second nerve bundle at the base of the spine, producing the genital outbreak.\n- The human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common STI in the United States.

[63]  Some cases may not be cleared and can lead to genital warts (bumps around the genitals that can be small or large, raised or fl at, or shaped like cauliflower) or cervical cancer and other HPV related cancers. Symptoms might not show up until advanced stages. It is important for women to get pap smears in order to check for and treat cancers. There are also two vaccines available for women (Cervarix and Gardasil) that protect against the types of HPV that cause cervical cancer. HPV can be passed through genital-togenital contact as well as during oral sex. The infected partner might not have any symptoms.\n- Gonorrhea is caused by bacterium that lives on moist mucous membranes in the urethra, vagina, rectum, mouth, throat, and eyes. The infection can spread through contact with the penis, vagina, mouth, or anus. Symptoms of gonorrhea usually appear two to five days after contact with an infected partner; however, some men might not notice symptoms for up to a month. Symptoms in men include burning and pain while urinating, increased urinary frequency, discharge from the penis (white, green, or yellow in color), red or swollen urethra, swollen or tender testicles, or sore throat. Symptoms in women may include vaginal discharge, burning or itching while urinating, painful sexual intercourse, severe pain in lower abdomen (if infection spreads to fallopian tubes), or fever (if infection spreads to fallopian tubes); however, many women do not show any symptoms. [64] Antibiotic resistant strains of Gonorrhea are a significant concern, but most cases can be cured with existing antibiotics.\n- Syphilis is an STI caused by a bacterium. Untreated, it can lead to complications and death. [65]  Clinical manifestations of syphilis include the ulceration of the uro-genital tract, mouth or rectum; if left untreated the symptoms worsen. In recent years, the prevalence of syphilis has declined in Western Europe, but it has increased in Eastern Europe (former Soviet states). A high incidence of syphilis can be found in places such as Cameroon, Cambodia, Papua New Guinea. [66]  Syphilis infections are increasing in the United States. [67]\n- Trichomoniasis is a common STI that is caused by infection with a protozoan parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis. [68]  Trichomoniasis affects both women and men, but symptoms are more common in women. [69]  Most patients are treated with an antibiotic called metronidazole, which is very effective. [70]\n- HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) damages the body's immune system, which interferes with its ability to  fi ght o ff  disease-causing agents. The virus kills CD4 cells, which are white blood cells that help fight off various infections. HIV is carried in body fluids and is spread by sexual activity. It can also be spread by contact with infected blood, breastfeeding, childbirth, and from mother to child during pregnancy. [71]  When HIV is at its most advanced stage, an individual is said to have AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). [72]  There are different stages of the progression of and HIV infection. The stages include primary infection, asymptomatic infection, symptomatic infection, and AIDS. In the primary infection stage, an individual will have flu-like symptoms (headache, fatigue, fever, muscle aches) for about two weeks. In the asymptomatic stage, symptoms usually disappear, and the patient can remain asymptomatic for years. When HIV progresses to the symptomatic stage, the immune system is weakened and has a low cell count of CD4+ T cells. When the HIV infection becomes life-threatening, it is called AIDS. People with AIDS fall prey to opportunistic infections and die as a result. [ 58 ]  When the disease was first discovered in the 1980s, those who had AIDS were not likely to live longer than a few years. There are now antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) available to treat HIV infections. There is no known cure for HIV or AIDS but the drugs help suppress the virus. By"

[73]\n\n\n# Viruses in semen\n\nTwenty-seven different viruses have been identified in semen. Information on whether or not transmission occurs or whether the viruses cause disease is uncertain. Some of these microbes are known to be sexually transmitted. [74]\n\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nMany STIs are (more easily) transmitted through the mucous membranes of the penis, vulva, rectum, urinary tract and (less often-depending on type of infection) the mouth, throat, respiratory tract and eyes. [75]  The visible  membrane  covering  the  head  of  the  penis  is  a  mucous  membrane,  though  it  produces  no  mucus (similar to the lips of the mouth). Mucous membranes differ from skin in that they allow certain pathogens into the body. The amount of contact with infective sources which causes infection varies with each pathogen but in all cases, a disease may result from even light contact from fluid carriers like venereal fluids onto a mucous membrane.\n\nSome STIs such as HIV can be transmitted from mother to child either during pregnancy or breastfeeding. [76][77]  Healthcare professionals suggest safer sex, such as the use of condoms, as a reliable way of decreasing the risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections during sexual activity, but safer sex cannot be considered to provide complete protection from an STI. The transfer of and exposure to bodily fluids, such as blood transfusions and other blood products, sharing injection needles, needle-stick injuries (when medical staff are inadvertently jabbed or pricked with needles during medical procedures), sharing tattoo needles, and childbirth  are  other  avenues  of  transmission.  These  different  means  put  certain  groups,  such  as  medical workers, and haemophiliacs and drug users, particularly at risk.\n\nIt  is  possible  to  be  an  asymptomatic  carrier  of  sexually  transmitted  infections.  In  particular,  sexually transmitted infections in women often cause the serious condition of pelvic inflammatory disease. [78]\n\n\n## Diagnosis\n\nTesting may be for a single infection, or consist of a number of tests for a range of STIs, including tests for syphilis, trichomonas, gonorrhea, chlamydia, herpes, hepatitis, and HIV. No procedure tests for all infectious agents.\n\n\nSTI tests may be used for a number of reasons:\n- as a diagnostic test to determine the cause of symptoms or illness\n- as a screening test to detect asymptomatic or presymptomatic infections\n- as a check that prospective sexual partners are free of disease before they engage in sex without safer sex precautions (for example, when starting a long term mutually monogamous sexual relationship, in fluid bonding, or for procreation).\n- as a check prior to or during pregnancy, to prevent harm to the baby\n- as a check after birth, to check that the baby has not caught an STI from the mother"

        "text": "- to prevent the use of infected donated blood or organs\n- as part of the process of contact tracing from a known infected individual\n- as part of mass epidemiological surveillance\n\n\nEarly  identification  and  treatment  results  in  less  chance  to  spread  disease,  and  for  some  conditions  may improve the outcomes of treatment. There is often a window period after initial infection during which an STI test will be negative. During this period, the infection may be transmissible. The duration of this period varies depending on the infection and the test. Diagnosis may also be delayed by reluctance of the infected person to seek a medical professional. One report indicated that people turn to the Internet rather than to a medical professional for information on STIs to a higher degree than for other sexual problems. [79]\n\n\n## Classification\n\nUntil the 1990s, STIs were commonly known as venereal diseases , an antiquated  euphemism  derived  from  the  Latin venereus ,  being  the adjectival form of Venus, the Roman goddess of love. [80]  However, in the  post-classical  education  era  the  euphemistic  effect  was  entirely lost, and the common abbreviation \"VD\" held only negative connotations.  Other  former  euphemisms  for  STIs  include  \"blood diseases\"  and  \"social  diseases\". [81]   The  present  euphemism  is  in  the use of the initials \"STI\" rather than in the words they represent. The World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  has  recommended  the  more inclusive  term sexually  transmitted  infection since  1999. [9]   Public health  officials  originally  introduced  the  term sexually  transmitted infection ,  which  clinicians  are  increasingly  using  alongside  the  term sexually  transmitted  disease in  order  to  distinguish  it  from  the former.\n\n\n## Prevention\n\nStrategies for reducing STI risk include: vaccination, mutual monogamy, reducing the number of sexual partners, and abstinence. [82]   Also  potentially  helpful  is  behavioral  counseling  for\n\nsexually active adolescents and for adults who are at increased risk. [83]  Such interactive counseling, which can be  resource-intensive,  is  directed  at  a  person's  risk,  the  situations  in  which  risk  occurs,  and  the  use  of personalized goal-setting strategies. [84]\n\nThe most effective way to prevent sexual transmission of STIs is to avoid contact of body parts or fluids which can lead to transfer with an infected partner. Not all sexual activities involve contact: cybersex, phone sex or masturbation from a distance are methods of avoiding contact. Proper use of condoms reduces contact and risk. Although a condom is effective in limiting exposure, some disease transmission may occur even with a condom. [85]\n\nBoth partners can get tested for STIs before initiating sexual contact, or before resuming contact if a partner engaged  in  contact  with  someone  else.  Many  infections  are  not  detectable  immediately  after  exposure,  so enough time must be allowed between possible exposures and testing for the tests  to  be  accurate.  Certain STIs, particularly certain persistent viruses like HPV, may be impossible to detect.\n\nSome  treatment  facilities  use  in-home  test  kits  and  have  the  person  return  the  test  for  follow-up.  Other facilities  strongly  encourage  that  those  previously  infected  return  to  ensure  that  the  infection  has  been eliminated. Novel strategies to foster re-testing have been the use of text messaging and email as reminders. These types  of  reminders  are  now  used  in  addition  to  phone  calls  and  letters. [86]   After  obtaining  a  sexual history, a healthcare provider can encourage risk reduction by providing prevention counseling. Prevention counseling  is  most  effective  if  provided  in  a  nonjudgmental  and  empathetic  manner  appropriate  to  the person's culture, language, gender, sexual orientation, age,  and developmental level. Prevention counseling for STIs is usually offered to all sexually active adolescents and to all adults who have received a diagnosis,  have  had  an  STI  in  the  past  year,  or  have  multiple  sex partners.

        "text": "# Vaccines\n\nVaccines  are  available  that  protect  against  some  viral  STIs,  such  as hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and some types of HPV. [87]  Vaccination before initiation  of  sexual  contact  is  advised  to  assure  maximal  protection. The development of vaccines to protect against gonorrhea is ongoing. [88]\n\n\n## Condoms\n\nCondoms  and  female  condoms  only  provide  protection  when  used properly as a barrier, and only to and from the area that they cover. Uncovered areas are still susceptible to many STIs.\n\nIn the case of HIV, sexual transmission routes almost always involve the  penis,  as  HIV  cannot  spread  through  unbroken  skin;  therefore, properly shielding the penis with a properly worn condom from the vagina or anus effectively stops HIV transmission. An infected fluid to broken skin borne direct transmission of HIV would not be considered\n\n\"sexually transmitted\", but can still theoretically occur during sexual contact. This can be avoided simply by not engaging in sexual contact when presenting open, bleeding wounds.\n\nOther  STIs,  even  viral  infections,  can  be  prevented  with  the  use  of  latex,  polyurethane  or  polyisoprene condoms  as  a  barrier.  Some  microorganisms  and  viruses  are  small  enough  to  pass  through  the  pores  in natural skin condoms but are still too large to pass through latex or synthetic condoms.\n\n\nProper male condom usage entails:\n- Not putting the condom on too tight at the tip by leaving 1.5 centimetres (0.6 in) room for ejaculation. Putting the condom on too tightly can and often does lead to failure.\n- Wearing a condom too loose can defeat the barrier\n- Avoiding inverting or spilling a condom once worn, whether it has ejaculate in it or not\n- If a user attempts to unroll the condom, but realizes they have it on the wrong side, then this condom may not be effective\n- Being careful with the condom if handling it with long nails\n- Avoiding the use of oil-based lubricants (or anything with oil in it) with latex condoms, as oil can eat holes into them\n- Using flavored condoms for oral sex only, as the sugar in the flavoring can lead to yeast infections if used to penetrate\n\n\nIn order to best protect oneself and the partner from STIs, the old condom and its contents are to be treated as infectious  and  properly  disposed  of.  A  new  condom  is  used  for  each  act  of  intercourse,  as  multiple  usages increase the chance of breakage, defeating the effectiveness as a barrier.\n\nIn the case of female condoms, the device consists of two rings, one in each terminal portion. The larger ring should fit  snugly  over  the  cervix  and  the  smaller  ring  remains  outside  the  vagina,  covering  the  vulva.  This system provides some protection of the external genitalia.

Both cover the cervix and the main difference between the diaphragm and the cap is that the latter must be used only once, using a new one in each sexual act. The diaphragm, however, can be used more than once. These two devices partially protect against STIs (they do not protect against HIV). [90]\n\nResearchers had hoped that nonoxynol-9, a vaginal microbicide would help decrease STI risk. Trials, however, have found it ineffective [91]  and it may put women at a higher risk of HIV infection. [92]  There is evidence that vaginal  dapivirine  probably  reduces  HIV  in  women  who  have  sex  with  men,  other  types  of  vaginal microbicides have not demonstrated effectiveness for HIV or STIs. [93]\n\nThere  is  little  evidence  that  school-based  interventions  such  as  sexual  and  reproductive  health  education programmes on contraceptive choices and condoms are effective on improving the sexual and reproductive health  of  adolescents.  Incentive-based  programmes  may  reduce  adolescent  pregnancy  but  more  data  is needed to confirm this. [94]\n\n\n## Screening\n\n\nSpecific age groups, persons who participate in risky sexual behavior, or those have certain health conditions may require screening. The CDC recommends that sexually active women under the age of 25 and those over 25 at risk should be screened for chlamydia and gonorrhea yearly. Appropriate times for screening are during regular  pelvic  examinations  and  preconception  evaluations. [95]   Nucleic  acid  amplification  tests  are  the recommended method of diagnosis for gonorrhea and chlamydia. [96]  This can be done on either urine in both men  and  women,  vaginal  or  cervical  swabs  in  women,  or  urethral  swabs  in  men. [96]   Screening  can  be performed:\n- to assess the presence of infection and prevent tubal infertility in women\n- during the initial evaluation before infertility treatment\n- to identify HIV infection\n- for men who have sex with men\n- for those who may have been exposed to hepatitis C\n- for HCV [96]\n\n\n\n## Management\n\nIn the case of rape, the person can be treated prophylacticly with antibiotics. [97]\n\nAn option for treating partners of patients (index cases) diagnosed with chlamydia or gonorrhea is patientdelivered partner therapy, which is the clinical practice of treating the sex partners of index cases by providing prescriptions  or  medications  to  the  patient  to  take  to  their  partner  without  the  health  care  provider  first examining the partner. [98]  In term of preventing reinfection in sexually transmitted infection, treatment with both  patient  and  the  sexual  partner  of  patient  resulted  in  more  successful  than  treatment  of  the  patient without the sexual partner. There is no difference in reinfection prevention whether the sexual partner treated with medication without medical examination or after notification by patient.

[1] At least an additional  530  million people have genital herpes and 290 million women have human  papillomavirus  (HPV). [1]   STIs  other  than  HIV resulted  in  142,000  deaths  in  2013. [101]   In  the  United States there were  19 million new  cases of sexually transmitted infections in 2010. [102]\n\nIn  2010,  19  million  new  cases  of  sexually  transmitted infections  occurred  in  women  in  the  United  States. [5]   A 2008 CDC study found that 25-40% of U.S. teenage girls has  a  sexually  transmitted  infection. [103][104]   Out  of  a population of almost 295,270,000 people [105]  there were 110  million  new  and  existing  cases  of  eight  sexually transmitted infections. [106]\n\nOver 400,000 sexually transmitted infections were reported in England in 2017, about the same as in 2016, but  there  were  more  than  20%  increases  in  confirmed cases of gonorrhoea and syphilis. Since 2008 syphilis cases have  risen  by  148%,  from  2,874  to  7,137,  mostly  among men who have sex with men. The number of first cases of genital warts in 2017 among girls aged 15-17 years was just 441,  90%  less  than  in  2009  -  attributed  to  the  national HPV immunisation programme. [107]\n\nAIDS is among the leading causes of death in present-day Sub-Saharan Africa. [108] HIV/AIDS is transmitted primarily  via  unprotected  sexual  intercourse.  More  than\n\n1.1  million  persons  are  living  with  HIV/AIDS  in  the  United  States, [109]   and  it  disproportionately  impacts African Americans. [110]  Hepatitis B is also considered a sexually transmitted infection because it can be spread through sexual contact. [111]  The highest rates are found in Asia and Africa and lower rates are in the Americas and  Europe. [112]   Approximately  two  billion  people  worldwide  have  been  infected  with  the  hepatitis  B virus. [113]\n\n\n## History\n\nThe first well-recorded European outbreak of what is now known as syphilis occurred in 1494 when it broke out  among  French  troops  besieging  Naples  in  the  Italian  War  of  1494-98. [114]   The  disease  may  have originated from the Columbian Exchange. [115][116]  From Naples, the disease swept across Europe, killing more than five million people. [117]  As Jared Diamond describes it, \"[W]hen syphilis was first definitely recorded in Europe  in  1495,  its  pustules  often  covered  the  body  from  the  head  to  the  knees,  caused  flesh  to  fall  from people's faces, and led to death within a few months,\" rendering it far more fatal than it is today. Diamond concludes,  \"[B]y  1546,  the  disease  had  evolved  into  the  disease  with  the  symptoms  so  well  known  to  us today.\" [118]  Gonorrhea is recorded at least up to 700 years ago and associated with a district in Paris formerly known as \"Le Clapiers\". This is where the prostitutes were to be found at that time. [88]\n\nPrior  to  the  invention  of  modern  medicines,  sexually  transmitted  infections  were  generally  incurable,  and treatment  was  limited  to  treating  the  symptoms  of  the  infection.  The  first  voluntary  hospital  for  STIs  was founded in 1746 at London Lock Hospital. [119]  Treatment was not always voluntary: in the second half of the 19th century, the Contagious Diseases Acts were used to arrest suspected prostitutes. In 1924, a number of states concluded the Brussels Agreement, whereby states agreed to provide free or low-cost medical treatment at ports for merchant seamen with STIs. A proponent of these approaches was Nora Wattie, OBE, Venereal"

[120]\n\nThe first effective treatment for a sexually transmitted infection was salvarsan, a treatment for syphilis. With the discovery of antibiotics, a large number of sexually transmitted infections became easily curable, and this, combined with effective public health campaigns against STIs, led to a public perception during the 1960s and 1970s that they have ceased to be a serious medical threat.\n\nDuring this period, the importance of contact tracing in treating STIs was recognized. By tracing the sexual partners of infected individuals, testing them for infection, treating the infected and tracing their contacts, in turn, STI clinics could effectively suppress infections in the general population.\n\nIn  the  1980s,  first  genital  herpes  and  then  AIDS  emerged  into  the  public  consciousness  as  sexually transmitted  infections  that  could  not  be  cured  by  modern  medicine.  AIDS,  in  particular,  has  a  long asymptomatic period-during which time HIV (the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS) can replicate and the disease can be transmitted to others-followed by a symptomatic period, which leads rapidly to death unless treated. HIV/AIDS entered the United States from Haiti in about 1969. [121]  Recognition that AIDS threatened a global pandemic led to public information campaigns and the development of treatments that allow AIDS to be managed by suppressing the replication of HIV for as long as possible. Contact tracing continues to be an important measure, even when diseases are incurable, as it helps to contain infection.\n\n\n## See also\n\n\n- List of sexually transmitted infections by prevalence"
