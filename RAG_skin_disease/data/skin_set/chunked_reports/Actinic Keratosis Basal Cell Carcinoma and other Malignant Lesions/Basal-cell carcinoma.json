[2]   It  often  appears  as  a  painless, raised area of skin, which may be shiny with small blood vessels running  over  it. [1]   It  may  also  present  as  a  raised  area  with ulceration. [1]  Basal-cell cancer grows slowly and can damage the tissue around it, but it is unlikely to spread to distant areas or result in death. [9]\n\nRisk  factors  include  exposure  to  ultraviolet  light  (UV),  having lighter  skin,  radiation  therapy,  long-term  exposure  to  arsenic, and  poor  immune-system  function. [2]   Exposure  to  UV  light during childhood is particularly harmful. [5]  Tanning beds have become  another  common  source  of  ultraviolet  radiation. [10] Diagnosis  often  depends  on  skin  examination,  confirmed  by tissue biopsy. [2][3]",

[2]   This can be by simple excision if the cancer is small; otherwise, Mohs surgery  is  generally  recommended. [2]   Other  options  include electrodesiccation and curettage, cryosurgery, topical chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy, laser surgery, or the use of  imiquimod,  a  topical  immune-activating  medication. [12]   In the rare cases in which distant spread has occurred, chemotherapy or targeted therapy may be used. [12]\n\nBasal-cell  cancer  accounts  for  at  least  32%  of  all  cancers globally. [9][13]  Of skin cancers other than melanoma, about 80% are BCCs. [2]  In the United States, about 35% of White males and 25% of White females are affected by BCC at some point in their lives.

[15]\n\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nBasal-cell carcinoma (BCC) is named after the basal cells that populate the lowest layer of the epidermis due to the histological appearance of the cancer cells under the microscope. [16]  Nevertheless, not all BCCs originate within the basal  layer. [16]   Some  are  thought  to  develop  from  the  folliculo-sebaceousapocrine germinative cells known as trichoblasts. Trichoblastic carcinoma is a term used to describe a rare and potentially aggressive malignancy that is also thought to arise from trichoblasts and may  resemble a benign trichoblastoma  (differential  diagnosis  can  be  challenging). [17][18][19]   It  has been  suggested  that  lesions  diagnosed  as  trichoblastic  carcinoma  may actually themselves be BCC. [20]\n\nOverexposure to the sun leads to the formation of thymine dimers, a form of DNA damage. While DNA repair removes most UV-induced damage, not all crosslinks  are  excised,  so  cumulative  DNA  damage  can  lead  to  mutations.\n\nBasal-cell carcinoma (BCC)\n\nmm",

Studies  of  the  role  of  DNA  repair  in  susceptibility  to  sunlightinduced BCC indicated that reduced DNA repair capacity is one of the underlying molecular mechanisms for sunlight-induced skin carcinogenesis in the general population. [21][22]\n\nBasal-cell carcinomas can often occur in association with other lesions of the skin, such as actinic keratosis, seborrheic keratosis, and squamous-cell carcinoma. [23]  In a small proportion of cases, BCC also develops as a result  of  basal-cell  nevus  syndrome,  or  Gorlin  syndrome,  which  is  also  characterized  by  keratocystic odontogenic tumors of the jaw, palmar or plantar (sole of the foot) pits, calcification of the falx cerebri (in the center line of the brain), and rib abnormalities. The cause of this syndrome is a mutation in the PTCH1 tumor suppressor gene located in chromosome 9q22.3, which inhibits the hedgehog signaling pathway. A mutation in the SMO gene, which is also on the hedgehog pathway, also causes BCC. [24]\n\n\n# Diagnosis",

Most nodular BCCs can be diagnosed clinically;  however,  other  variants  can  be  challenging  to  distinguish from benign lesions such as intradermal naevus, sebaceomas, fibrous papules,  early  acne  scars,  and  hypertrophic  scarring. [25]   Exfoliative cytology methods have high sensitivity and specificity for confirming the  diagnosis  of  BCC  when  clinical  suspicion  is  high,  but  of  unclear usefulness otherwise. [26]\n\n\n## Characteristics\n\nBasal-cell  carcinoma  cells  resemble  epidermal  basal  cells  and  are usually well differentiated.

During the surgery, after each tissue removal and while the patient waits, the tissue is examined for cancer cells. That examination dictates the decision for additional tissue removal.

The skin is then burned with an electric current. This further softens the skin, allowing for the knife to cut more deeply with the next layer of curettage. The cycle is repeated, with a safety margin of curettage of normal skin around the visible tumor. This cycle is repeated 3 to 5 times, and the free skin margin treated is usually 4 to 6 mm. Cure rate is very much user-dependent and depends also on the size and type of tumor. Infiltrative or morpheaform BCCs can be difficult to eradicate with EDC. Generally, this method is used on cosmetically unimportant areas like the trunk (torso). Some physicians believe that it is acceptable to utilize EDC on the face of elderly patients over the age of 70. However, with increasing life expectancy, such an objective criterion cannot be supported. The cure rate can vary, depending on the aggressiveness of the EDC and the free margin treated. Some advocate curettage alone without electrodesiccation, and with the same cure rate. [54]\n\n\n## Chemotherapy",

Although radiotherapy is generally used in older patients who are not candidates for surgery, it is also used in cases where surgical excision will be disfiguring or difficult to reconstruct (especially on the tip of the nose and the nostril rims). Radiation treatment with external radiation often takes as few as 5 visits to as many as 25 visits. Usually, the more visits scheduled for therapy, the less complication or damage is done to the normal tissue supporting the tumor. Radiotherapy can also be useful if surgical excision has been done incompletely or if the pathology report following surgery suggests a high risk of recurrence, for example, if nerve involvement has been demonstrated. The cure rate can be as high as 95% for small tumors or as low as 80% for large tumors. A variation of an external brachytherapy is the epidermal radioisotope therapy (e.g., with 188 Re  in  the  form  of  the  Rhenium-SCT).  It  is  used  in  accordance  with  the  general  indications  for brachytherapy and especially complex localisations or structures (e.g., earlobe) as well as the genitals. [60]",

Recurrent  cancers  are  much  harder  to  cure,  with  a  higher  recurrence  rate,  with  the  method  of  treatment. Although  basal-cell  carcinoma  rarely  metastasizes,  it  grows  locally  with  invasion  and  destruction  of  local tissues.  The  cancer  can  impinge  on  vital  structures  like  nerves  and  result  in  loss  of  sensation  or  loss  of function, or rarely death. The vast majority of cases can be successfully treated before serious complications occur. The recurrence rate for the above treatment options ranges from 50 percent to 1 percent or less.\n\nThe  nose  and  temporal  region  are  the  most  common  areas  for  basal-cell  carcinoma  of  the  face. [62]   When completely excised, the recurrence rate for basal-cell carcinoma is relatively low. However, when recurrence occurs  among surgically  treated  basal-cell  carcinomas  of  the  face,  there  is  a  strong  correlation  with  tumor thickness. [62]\n\n\n## Epidemiology",

It increases in incidence closer to the equator or at higher altitudes. It  is  very  common  among  elderly  people  over  the  age  of  80. [63]   There  are  approximately  800,000 [64]   new cases  yearly  in  the  United  States  alone.  Up  to  30%  of  white  people  develop  basal-cell  carcinomas  in  their lifetime.

        "text": "# Basal-cell carcinoma\n\nBasal-cell  carcinoma ( BCC ),  also  known  as basal-cell cancer , basalioma , [7] or rodent  ulcer , [8] is the  most common type of skin cancer. [2]   It  often  appears  as  a  painless, raised area of skin, which may be shiny with small blood vessels running  over  it. [1]   It  may  also  present  as  a  raised  area  with ulceration. [1]  Basal-cell cancer grows slowly and can damage the tissue around it, but it is unlikely to spread to distant areas or result in death. [9]\n\nRisk  factors  include  exposure  to  ultraviolet  light  (UV),  having lighter  skin,  radiation  therapy,  long-term  exposure  to  arsenic, and  poor  immune-system  function. [2]   Exposure  to  UV  light during childhood is particularly harmful. [5]  Tanning beds have become  another  common  source  of  ultraviolet  radiation. [10] Diagnosis  often  depends  on  skin  examination,  confirmed  by tissue biopsy. [2][3]\n\nWhether sunscreen affects the risk of basal-cell cancer remains unclear. [11]   Treatment  is  typically  by  surgical  removal. [2]   This can be by simple excision if the cancer is small; otherwise, Mohs surgery  is  generally  recommended. [2]   Other  options  include electrodesiccation and curettage, cryosurgery, topical chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy, laser surgery, or the use of  imiquimod,  a  topical  immune-activating  medication. [12]   In the rare cases in which distant spread has occurred, chemotherapy or targeted therapy may be used. [12]\n\nBasal-cell  cancer  accounts  for  at  least  32%  of  all  cancers globally. [9][13]  Of skin cancers other than melanoma, about 80% are BCCs. [2]  In the United States, about 35% of White males and 25% of White females are affected by BCC at some point in their lives.

[15]\n\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nBasal-cell carcinoma (BCC) is named after the basal cells that populate the lowest layer of the epidermis due to the histological appearance of the cancer cells under the microscope. [16]  Nevertheless, not all BCCs originate within the basal  layer. [16]   Some  are  thought  to  develop  from  the  folliculo-sebaceousapocrine germinative cells known as trichoblasts. Trichoblastic carcinoma is a term used to describe a rare and potentially aggressive malignancy that is also thought to arise from trichoblasts and may  resemble a benign trichoblastoma  (differential  diagnosis  can  be  challenging). [17][18][19]   It  has been  suggested  that  lesions  diagnosed  as  trichoblastic  carcinoma  may actually themselves be BCC. [20]\n\nOverexposure to the sun leads to the formation of thymine dimers, a form of DNA damage. While DNA repair removes most UV-induced damage, not all crosslinks  are  excised,  so  cumulative  DNA  damage  can  lead  to  mutations.\n\nBasal-cell carcinoma (BCC)\n\nmm\n\nMicrograph of a basal-cell carcinoma, showing the characteristic histomorphologic features (peripheral palisading, myxoid stroma, artefactual clefting), H&E stain"

        "text": "Apart from the mutagenesis, overexposure to sunlight depresses the local immune system, possibly decreasing immune  surveillance  for  new  tumor  cells.  Studies  of  the  role  of  DNA  repair  in  susceptibility  to  sunlightinduced BCC indicated that reduced DNA repair capacity is one of the underlying molecular mechanisms for sunlight-induced skin carcinogenesis in the general population. [21][22]\n\nBasal-cell carcinomas can often occur in association with other lesions of the skin, such as actinic keratosis, seborrheic keratosis, and squamous-cell carcinoma. [23]  In a small proportion of cases, BCC also develops as a result  of  basal-cell  nevus  syndrome,  or  Gorlin  syndrome,  which  is  also  characterized  by  keratocystic odontogenic tumors of the jaw, palmar or plantar (sole of the foot) pits, calcification of the falx cerebri (in the center line of the brain), and rib abnormalities. The cause of this syndrome is a mutation in the PTCH1 tumor suppressor gene located in chromosome 9q22.3, which inhibits the hedgehog signaling pathway. A mutation in the SMO gene, which is also on the hedgehog pathway, also causes BCC. [24]\n\n\n# Diagnosis\n\nTo  diagnose  basal-cell  carcinomas,  a  skin  biopsy  is  performed  for histopathologic analysis. The most common method is a shave biopsy under local anesthesia. Most nodular BCCs can be diagnosed clinically;  however,  other  variants  can  be  challenging  to  distinguish from benign lesions such as intradermal naevus, sebaceomas, fibrous papules,  early  acne  scars,  and  hypertrophic  scarring. [25]   Exfoliative cytology methods have high sensitivity and specificity for confirming the  diagnosis  of  BCC  when  clinical  suspicion  is  high,  but  of  unclear usefulness otherwise. [26]\n\n\n## Characteristics\n\nBasal-cell  carcinoma  cells  resemble  epidermal  basal  cells  and  are usually well differentiated. [27]\n\nIn uncertain cases, immunohistochemistry using BerEP4 can be used, having a high sensitivity and specificity in detecting only BCC cells. [28]\n\n\n## Main classes\n\nBasal-cell carcinoma can broadly be divided into three groups, based on the growth patterns.\n\n\n- Superficial basal-cell carcinoma, formerly referred to as in-situ basal-cell carcinoma, is characterized by a superficial proliferation of neoplastic basal-cells. This tumor is generally responsive to topical chemotherapy, such as imiquimod, or fl uorouracil, although surgical treatment is better able to ensure complete removal and confirm that there is not an underlying more aggressive subtype that was not sampled in the initial biopsy.\n- In fi ltrative basal-cell carcinoma, which also encompasses morpheaform and micronodular basal-cell cancer, is more difficult to treat with conservative methods, given its tendency to penetrate into deeper layers of the skin.\n- Nodular basal-cell carcinoma includes most of the remaining categories of basal-cell cancer. It is not unusual to encounter heterogeneous morphologic features within the same tumor."

        "text": "effective for the prevention of either of these keratinocyte-derived cancers. [38]  The review did ultimately state that the certainty of these results was low, so future evidence could very well alter this conclusion. One-third occur in non-sun-exposed areas; thus, the pathogenesis is more complex than UV exposure as the cause. [15]\n\nThe use of a chemotherapeutic agent such as 5-Fluorouracil or imiquimod can prevent the development of skin cancer. It is usually recommended to individuals with extensive sun damage, a history of multiple skin cancers, or rudimentary forms of cancer (i.e., solar keratosis). [39]  It is often repeated every 2 to 3 years to decrease the risk of skin cancer further.\n\n\n# Treatment\n\nThe following methods are employed in the treatment of basal-cell carcinoma (BCC):\n\n\n## Standard surgical excision\n\nSurgery  to  remove  the  basal-cell  carcinoma  affected  area  and  the surrounding skin is thought to be the most effective treatment. [40]  A disadvantage  with  standard  surgical  excision  is  a  reported  higher recurrence rate of basal-cell cancers of the face, [41]  especially around the  eyelids, [42]   nose,  and  facial  structures. [43]   There  is  no  clear approach,  nor  clear  research  comparing  the  effectiveness  of  Mohs micrographic surgery versus surgical excision for BCC of the eye. [44]\n\nFor basal cell carcinoma excisions on the lower lip, the wound can be covered with a keystone flap. A keystone flap is achieved by creating a flap below the defect and pulling it superiorly to cover the wound. This can be performed if there is enough skin laxity to cover the defect and adequate blood supply to the flap. [45]\n\n\n## Mohs surgery\n\nFor many new (primary) and all recurrent forms of basal cell carcinoma after previous surgery, especially on the head, neck, hands, feet, genitalia, and anterior legs (shins), Mohs surgery should be considered. [46][47]\n\nMohs surgery (or Mohs micrographic surgery) is an outpatient procedure, developed by Frederic E. Mohs in the 1930s, [24]  in which the tumor is surgically excised and then immediately examined under a microscope. It is a form of pathology processing called CCPDMA, which means that the entire surgical margin (both edges and deep) is examined. During the surgery, after each tissue removal and while the patient waits, the tissue is examined for cancer cells. That examination dictates the decision for additional tissue removal. Mohs surgery is also used for squamous-cell carcinoma, melanoma,  atypical fibroxanthoma,  dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, Merkel cell carcinoma, microcystic adnexal carcinoma, and multiple other skin cancers; [47][48] usually with cure rates higher than for other surgical and non-surgical treatments. [48]\n\nAn essential aspect of Mohs surgery is that the Mohs surgeon performs the surgery and personally reviews the Mohs pathology slides. [47]  Most standard excisions done in an office setting are sent to an outside laboratory for standard bread loafing methods of processing. [49]  With this method, it is likely that less than 5% of the surgical margin is examined, as each slice of tissue is only 6 micrometres thick, about 3 to 4 serial slices are obtained per section, and only about 3 to 4 sections are obtained per specimen. [50]\n\n\n## Cryosurgery\n\nCryosurgery  is  an  old  modality  for  the  treatment  of  many  skin  cancers.  When  accurately  utilized  with  a temperature probe and cryotherapy instruments, it can result in a very good cure rate. Disadvantages include a  lack  of  margin  control,  tissue  necrosis,  over-  or  under-treatment  of  the  tumor,  and  long  recovery  time."

        "text": "Overall, there is sufficient data to consider cryosurgery as a reasonable treatment for BCC. There are no good studies, however, comparing cryosurgery with other modalities, particularly with Mohs surgery, excision, or electrodesiccation and curettage, so no conclusion can be made whether cryosurgery is as efficacious as other methods. Also, there is no evidence on whether curetting the lesions before cryosurgery affects the efficacy of treatment. [51]  Several textbooks are published on the therapy, and a few physicians still apply the treatment to selected patients. [52]\n\n\n# Electrodesiccation and curettage\n\nElectrodesiccation  and  curettage  (EDC,  also  known  as  curettage  and  cautery,  simply  curettage) [53]   is accomplished by using a round knife, or curette, to scrape away the soft cancer. The skin is then burned with an electric current. This further softens the skin, allowing for the knife to cut more deeply with the next layer of curettage. The cycle is repeated, with a safety margin of curettage of normal skin around the visible tumor. This cycle is repeated 3 to 5 times, and the free skin margin treated is usually 4 to 6 mm. Cure rate is very much user-dependent and depends also on the size and type of tumor. Infiltrative or morpheaform BCCs can be difficult to eradicate with EDC. Generally, this method is used on cosmetically unimportant areas like the trunk (torso). Some physicians believe that it is acceptable to utilize EDC on the face of elderly patients over the age of 70. However, with increasing life expectancy, such an objective criterion cannot be supported. The cure rate can vary, depending on the aggressiveness of the EDC and the free margin treated. Some advocate curettage alone without electrodesiccation, and with the same cure rate. [54]\n\n\n## Chemotherapy\n\nSome superficial cancers respond to local therapy with 5-fluorouracil, a chemotherapy agent. One can expect a great deal of inflammation with this treatment. [55]  Chemotherapy often follows Mohs surgery to eliminate the residual  superficial  basal-cell  carcinoma  after  the  invasive  portion  is  removed.  5-fluorouracil  has  received FDA approval.\n\nRemoving the residual superficial tumor with surgery alone can result in large and difficult-to-repair surgical defects. One often waits a month or more after surgery before starting the immunotherapy or chemotherapy to make sure the surgical wound has adequately healed. Some people advocate the use of curettage (see EDC below) first, followed by chemotherapy. These experimental procedures are not standard care. [53]\n\nVismodegib and sonidegib are drugs approved specifically for treating BCC, but are expensive and cannot be used in pregnant women.\n\nItraconazole, traditionally an antifungal medication, has also garnered recent attention for its potential use in the treatment of BCC, especially those that cannot be removed surgically. Possessing anti-Hedgehog pathway activity,  there  is  clinical  evidence  that  itraconazole  has  some  efficacy  either  alone  or  when  combined  with vismodegib/sonidegib  for  primary  and  recurrent  BCC.  There  is  one  case  report  of  efficacy  in  metastatic BCC. [56]\n\n\n## Immunotherapy\n\nThis technique uses the body's immune system to kill cancer cells. Improvement of the immune system works its way up to the cancerous cells and treats the skin cancer.\n\nTopical  treatment  with  5%  Imiquimod  cream  (IMQ),  with  five  applications  per  week  for  six  weeks,  has  a reported 70-90% success rate at reducing, even removing, the BCC [basal-cell carcinoma]. Imiquimod has received FDA approval, and topical IMQ is approved by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of small  superficial  basal-cell  carcinoma. [53]   Off-label  use  of  imiquimod  on  invasive  basal-cell  carcinoma  has been reported. Imiquimod may be used before surgery to reduce the size of the carcinoma.\n\nSome  advocate  the  use  of  imiquimod  before  Mohs  surgery  to  remove  the  superficial  component  of  the cancer.

        "text": "Research  suggests  that  treatment  using Euphorbia  peplus ,  a  common  garden  weed,  may  be  effective. [58] Australian biopharmaceutical company Peplin [59]  is developing this as topical treatment for BCC.\n\n\n# Radiation\n\nRadiation therapy can be delivered either as external beam radiotherapy or as brachytherapy (mostly internal radiotherapy). Although radiotherapy is generally used in older patients who are not candidates for surgery, it is also used in cases where surgical excision will be disfiguring or difficult to reconstruct (especially on the tip of the nose and the nostril rims). Radiation treatment with external radiation often takes as few as 5 visits to as many as 25 visits. Usually, the more visits scheduled for therapy, the less complication or damage is done to the normal tissue supporting the tumor. Radiotherapy can also be useful if surgical excision has been done incompletely or if the pathology report following surgery suggests a high risk of recurrence, for example, if nerve involvement has been demonstrated. The cure rate can be as high as 95% for small tumors or as low as 80% for large tumors. A variation of an external brachytherapy is the epidermal radioisotope therapy (e.g., with 188 Re  in  the  form  of  the  Rhenium-SCT).  It  is  used  in  accordance  with  the  general  indications  for brachytherapy and especially complex localisations or structures (e.g., earlobe) as well as the genitals. [60]\n\nUsually,  recurrent  tumors  after  radiation  are  treated  with  surgery,  not  with  radiation.  Further  radiation treatment will further damage normal tissue, and the tumor might be resistant to further radiation. Radiation therapy  may  be  contraindicated  for  the  treatment  of  nevoid  basal-cell  carcinoma  syndrome.  A  2008  study reported that radiation therapy is appropriate for primary BCCs and recurrent BCCs, but not for BCCs that have recurred following previous radiation treatment. [53]\n\n\n## Photodynamic therapy\n\nPhotodynamic  therapy  (PDT)  is  a  new  modality  for  the  treatment  of  basal-cell  carcinoma,  which  is administered  by  application  of  photosensitizers  to  the  target  area.  When  these  molecules  are  activated  by light, they become toxic, therefore destroying the target cells. Methyl aminolevulinate has been approved by the EU as a photosensitizer since 2001. This therapy is also used in other skin cancer types. [61]  A 2008 study reported that PDT was a good treatment option for primary superficial BCCs and reasonable for primary lowrisk nodular BCCs, but was a \"relatively poor\" option for high-risk lesions. [53]\n\n\n## Prognosis\n\nPrognosis  is  excellent  if  the  appropriate  method  of  treatment  is  used  in  early  primary  basal-cell  cancers. Recurrent  cancers  are  much  harder  to  cure,  with  a  higher  recurrence  rate,  with  the  method  of  treatment. Although  basal-cell  carcinoma  rarely  metastasizes,  it  grows  locally  with  invasion  and  destruction  of  local tissues.  The  cancer  can  impinge  on  vital  structures  like  nerves  and  result  in  loss  of  sensation  or  loss  of function, or rarely death. The vast majority of cases can be successfully treated before serious complications occur. The recurrence rate for the above treatment options ranges from 50 percent to 1 percent or less.\n\nThe  nose  and  temporal  region  are  the  most  common  areas  for  basal-cell  carcinoma  of  the  face. [62]   When completely excised, the recurrence rate for basal-cell carcinoma is relatively low. However, when recurrence occurs  among surgically  treated  basal-cell  carcinomas  of  the  face,  there  is  a  strong  correlation  with  tumor thickness. [62]\n\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nBasal-cell cancer is a very common skin cancer. It is much more common in White individuals and anyone with a family history of basal-cell cancer. It increases in incidence closer to the equator or at higher altitudes. It  is  very  common  among  elderly  people  over  the  age  of  80. [63]   There  are  approximately  800,000 [64]   new cases  yearly  in  the  United  States  alone.  Up  to  30%  of  white  people  develop  basal-cell  carcinomas  in  their lifetime. [65]   In  Canada,  the  most  common  skin  cancer  is  basal-cell  carcinoma  (as  much  as  one-third  of  all cancer diagnoses), affecting 1 in 7 individuals over a lifetime. [66]  This tumor accounts for approximately 70% of  non-melanoma  skin  cancers.  In  80  percent  of  all  cases,  basal-cell  carcinoma  affects  the  head  or  neck skin. [65]"
