[4][5]   Actinic  keratosis  is  a  disorder  ( -osis )  of epidermal keratinocytes that is induced by ultraviolet (UV) light exposure ( actin-). [6]\n\nThese  growths  are  more  common  in  fair-skinned  people  and those who are frequently in the sun. [7]  They are believed to form when skin gets damaged by UV radiation from the sun or indoor tanning  beds,  usually  over  the  course  of  decades.  Given  their pre-cancerous nature, if left untreated, they may turn into a type of  skin  cancer  called  squamous  cell  carcinoma. [5]   Untreated lesions have up to a 20% risk of progression to squamous cell carcinoma, [8]  so treatment by a dermatologist is recommended.",

[24]   Actinic  keratoses  are  usually  diagnosed  clinically,  but  because  they  are difficult to clinically differentiate from squamous cell carcinoma, any concerning features warrant biopsy for diagnostic confirmation. [25]\n\n\n# Causes\n\nThe most important cause of actinic keratosis formation is solar radiation, through a variety of mechanisms. Mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, induced by UV radiation, has been identified as a crucial step in actinic keratosis formation. [26]  This tumor suppressor gene, located on chromosome 17p132, allows for cell cycle arrest when DNA or RNA is damaged. Dysregulation of the p53 pathway can thus result in unchecked replication of dysplastic keratinocytes, thereby serving as a source of neoplastic growth and the development of actinic keratosis, as well as possible progression from actinic keratosis to skin cancer. [27]  Other molecular markers that have been associated with the development of actinic keratosis include the expression of p16 ink4 , p14,  the  CD95  ligand,  TNF-related  apoptosis-inducing  ligand  (TRAIL)  and  TRAIL  receptors,  and  loss  of heterozygosity.

The HPV virus has been detected in actinic keratoses, with measurable HPV viral loads (one HPVDNA copy per less than 50 cells) measured in 40% of actinic keratoses. [29]  Similar to UV radiation, higher levels of HPV found in actinic keratoses reflect enhanced viral DNA replication. This is suspected to be related to  the  abnormal  keratinocyte  proliferation  and  differentiation  in  actinic  keratoses,  which  facilitate  an environment  for  HPV  replication.  This  in  turn  may  further  stimulate  the  abnormal  proliferation  that contributes to the development of actinic keratoses and carcinogenesis.\n\n\n## Ultraviolet radiation",

Both  UV-A  and  UV-B  radiation  have  been implicated as causes of actinic keratoses. UV-A radiation (wavelength 320-400 nm) reaches more deeply into the skin and can lead to the generation of reactive oxygen species, which in turn can damage cell membranes, signaling  proteins,  and  nucleic  acids.  UV-B  radiation  (wavelength  290-320  nm)  causes  thymidine  dimer formation in DNA and RNA, leading to significant cellular mutations.

In one study, actinic keratoses were found in 55% of fair-skinned men with high cumulative sun exposure, and in only 19% of fair-skinned men with low cumulative sun exposure in an age-matched cohort (the percents for women in this same study were 37% and 12% respectively). [ 31 ] Furthermore, the use of sunscreen (SPF 17 or higher) has been found to significantly reduce the development of actinic keratosis lesions, and also promotes the regression of existing lesions.

[4][5]   Actinic  keratosis  is  a  disorder  ( -osis )  of epidermal keratinocytes that is induced by ultraviolet (UV) light exposure ( actin-). [6]\n\nThese  growths  are  more  common  in  fair-skinned  people  and those who are frequently in the sun. [7]  They are believed to form when skin gets damaged by UV radiation from the sun or indoor tanning  beds,  usually  over  the  course  of  decades.  Given  their pre-cancerous nature, if left untreated, they may turn into a type of  skin  cancer  called  squamous  cell  carcinoma. [5]   Untreated lesions have up to a 20% risk of progression to squamous cell carcinoma, [8]  so treatment by a dermatologist is recommended.\n\nActinic  keratoses  characteristically  appear  as  thick,  scaly,  or crusty areas that often feel dry or rough. Size commonly ranges between 2 and 6 millimeters,  but  they  can  grow  to  be  several centimeters in diameter. Actinic keratoses are often felt before they  are  seen,  and  the  texture  is  sometimes  compared  to sandpaper. [9] They may  be  dark, light, tan, pink, red,  a\n\ncombination of all these, or have the same color as the surrounding skin.\n\nGiven  the  causal  relationship  between  sun  exposure  and  actinic  keratosis  growth,  they  often  appear  on  a background of sun-damaged skin and in areas that are commonly sun-exposed, such as the face, ears, neck, scalp, chest, backs of hands, forearms, or lips. Because sun exposure is rarely limited to a small area, most people who have an actinic keratosis have more than one. [10]\n\nIf  clinical  examination  findings  are  not  typical  of  actinic  keratosis  and  the  possibility  of  in  situ  or  invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cannot be excluded based on clinical examination alone, a biopsy or excision can  be  considered  for  definitive  diagnosis  by  histologic  examination  of  the  lesional  tissue. [11]   Multiple treatment  options  for  actinic  keratosis  are  available.  Photodynamic  therapy  (PDT)  is  one  option  for  the treatment  of  numerous  actinic  keratosis  lesions  in  a  region  of  the  skin,  termed  field  cancerization. [12]   It involves the application of a photosensitizer to the skin followed by illumination with a strong light source. Topical creams, such as 5-fluorouracil or imiquimod, may require daily application to affected skin areas over a typical time course of weeks. [13]\n\nCryotherapy  is  frequently  used  for  few  and  well-defined  lesions, [14]   but  undesired  skin  lightening,  or hypopigmentation, may occur at the treatment site. [15]  By following up with a dermatologist, actinic keratoses can be treated before they progress to skin cancer. If cancer does develop from an actinic keratosis lesion, it can be caught early with close monitoring, at a time when treatment is likely to have a high cure rate.\n\n\n## Signs and symptoms\n\nActinic  keratoses  (AKs)  most  commonly  present  as  a  white,  scaly  plaque  of  variable  thickness  with surrounding redness; they have a sandpaper-like texture when felt with a gloved hand. Skin nearby the lesion often shows evidence of solar damage characterized by pigmentary alterations, being yellow or pale in color\n\nOther names\n\nSolar keratosis, senile keratosis (SK)"

[16]\n\nPhotoaging leads to an accumulation of oncogenic changes, resulting in a proliferation of mutated keratinocytes that can manifest as actinic keratoses or other neoplastic growths. [17]\n\nThe lesions are usually asymptomatic, but can be tender, itch, bleed, or  produce a stinging or burning sensation. [18]   Actinic  keratoses  are typically graded in accordance with their clinical presentation: Grade I (easily  visible,  slightly  palpable),  Grade  II  (easily  visible,  palpable), and Grade III (frankly visible and hyperkeratotic). [19]\n\n\n## Variants\n\n\nActinic keratoses can have various clinical presentations, often characterized as follows:\n- Classic (or common): Classic actinic keratoses present as white, scaly macules, papules or plaques of various thickness, often with surrounding erythema. They are usually 2-6mm in diameter but can sometimes reach several centimeters in diameter. [18]\n- Hypertrophic (or hyperkeratotic): Hypertrophic actinic keratoses (HAKs) appears as a thicker scale or rough papule or plaque, often adherent to an erythematous base. Classic actinic keratoses can progress to become HAKs, and HAKs themselves can be difficult to distinguish from malignant lesions.\n- Atrophic: Atrophic actinic keratoses lack an overlying scale, and therefore appear as a nonpalpable change in color (or macule). They are often smooth and red and are less than 10mm in diameter.\n\n\nClose-up view of an actinic keratosis lesion\n\n\n- Actinic keratosis with cutaneous horn: A cutaneous horn is a keratinic projection with its height at least one-half of its diameter, often conical in shape. They can be seen in the setting of actinic keratosis as a progression of an HAK, but are also present in other skin conditions. [18]   38-40% of cutaneous horns represent actinic keratoses. [20]\n- Pigmented actinic keratosis: Pigmented actinic keratoses are rare variants that often present as macules or plaques that are tan to brown in color. They can be difficult to distinguish from a solar lentigo or lentigo maligna. [21]\n- Actinic cheilitis: When an actinic keratosis forms on the lip, it is called actinic cheilitis. This usually presents as a rough, scaly patch on the lip, often accompanied by the sensation of dry mouth and symptomatic splitting of the lips.\n- Bowenoid actinic keratosis: Usually presents as a solitary, erythematous, scaly patch or plaque with well-defined borders. Bowenoid actinic keratoses are differentiated from Bowen's disease by degree of epithelial involvement as seen on histology. [22]\n\n\nThe  presence  of  ulceration,  nodularity,  or  bleeding  should  raise  concern  for  malignancy. [23]   Specifically, clinical  findings  suggesting an increased risk of progression to squamous cell carcinoma can be recognized as  \"IDRBEU\":  I  (induration/inflammation),  D  (diameter  >  1  cm),  R  (rapid  enlargement),  B  (bleeding),  E"

[24]   Actinic  keratoses  are  usually  diagnosed  clinically,  but  because  they  are difficult to clinically differentiate from squamous cell carcinoma, any concerning features warrant biopsy for diagnostic confirmation. [25]\n\n\n# Causes\n\nThe most important cause of actinic keratosis formation is solar radiation, through a variety of mechanisms. Mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, induced by UV radiation, has been identified as a crucial step in actinic keratosis formation. [26]  This tumor suppressor gene, located on chromosome 17p132, allows for cell cycle arrest when DNA or RNA is damaged. Dysregulation of the p53 pathway can thus result in unchecked replication of dysplastic keratinocytes, thereby serving as a source of neoplastic growth and the development of actinic keratosis, as well as possible progression from actinic keratosis to skin cancer. [27]  Other molecular markers that have been associated with the development of actinic keratosis include the expression of p16 ink4 , p14,  the  CD95  ligand,  TNF-related  apoptosis-inducing  ligand  (TRAIL)  and  TRAIL  receptors,  and  loss  of heterozygosity. [28][27]\n\nEvidence  also  suggests  that  the  human  papillomavirus  (HPV)  plays  a  role  in  the  development  of  actinic keratoses. The HPV virus has been detected in actinic keratoses, with measurable HPV viral loads (one HPVDNA copy per less than 50 cells) measured in 40% of actinic keratoses. [29]  Similar to UV radiation, higher levels of HPV found in actinic keratoses reflect enhanced viral DNA replication. This is suspected to be related to  the  abnormal  keratinocyte  proliferation  and  differentiation  in  actinic  keratoses,  which  facilitate  an environment  for  HPV  replication.  This  in  turn  may  further  stimulate  the  abnormal  proliferation  that contributes to the development of actinic keratoses and carcinogenesis.\n\n\n## Ultraviolet radiation\n\nIt  is  thought  that  ultraviolet  (UV)  radiation  induces  mutations  in  the  keratinocytes  of  the  epidermis, promoting the survival  and  proliferation  of  these  atypical  cells.  Both  UV-A  and  UV-B  radiation  have  been implicated as causes of actinic keratoses. UV-A radiation (wavelength 320-400 nm) reaches more deeply into the skin and can lead to the generation of reactive oxygen species, which in turn can damage cell membranes, signaling  proteins,  and  nucleic  acids.  UV-B  radiation  (wavelength  290-320  nm)  causes  thymidine  dimer formation in DNA and RNA, leading to significant cellular mutations. [30]  In particular, mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene have been found in 30-50% of actinic keratosis lesion skin samples. [26][28]\n\n\nUV radiation has also been shown to cause elevated inflammatory markers such as arachidonic acid, as well as other molecules associated with inflammation. [27]  Eventually, over time these changes lead to the formation of  actinic  keratoses.  Several  predictors  for  increased  actinic  keratosis  risk  from  UV  radiation  have  been identified:\n- Extent of sun exposure: Cumulative sun exposure leads to an increased risk for development of actinic keratoses. In one study, actinic keratoses were found in 55% of fair-skinned men with high cumulative sun exposure, and in only 19% of fair-skinned men with low cumulative sun exposure in an age-matched cohort (the percents for women in this same study were 37% and 12% respectively). [ 31 ] Furthermore, the use of sunscreen (SPF 17 or higher) has been found to significantly reduce the development of actinic keratosis lesions, and also promotes the regression of existing lesions. [ 32 ]\n- History of sunburn: Studies show that even a single episode of painful sunburn as a child can increase an individual's risk of developing actinic keratosis as an adult. [ 33 ] Six or more painful sunburns over the course of a lifetime was found to be significantly associated with the likelihood of developing actinic keratosis. [ 33 ]"

        "text": "# Skin pigmentation\n\nMelanin  is  a  pigment  in  the  epidermis  that  functions  to  protect keratinocytes from the damage caused by UV radiation; it is found in higher concentrations in the epidermis of darker-skinned individuals, affording them protection against the development of actinic keratoses.\n\nFair-skinned individuals have a significantly increased risk of developing actinic keratoses when compared to olive-skinned individuals (odds ratios of 14.1 and 6.5, respectively), [33]  and actinic keratoses are uncommon in dark-skinned people of African descent. [31]  Other phenotypic features seen in fair-skinned individuals that  are  associated  with  an  increased  propensity  to  develop  actinic keratoses include: [31]\n\n\n- Freckling\n- Light hair and eye color\n- Propensity to sunburn\n- Inability to tan\n\n\n\n## Other risk factors\n\n\n- Immunosuppression: People with a compromised immune system from medical conditions (such as AIDS) or immunosuppressive therapy (such as chronic immunosuppression after organ transplantation, or chemotherapy for cancer) are at increased risk for developing actinic keratoses. [34]  They may develop actinic keratosis at an earlier age or have an increased number of actinic keratosis lesions compared to immunocompetent people. [35]\n- Human papillomavirus (HPV): The role of HPV in the development of actinic keratosis remains unclear, but evidence suggests that infection with the betapapillomavirus type of HPV may be associated with an increased likelihood of AK. [36]\n- Genodermatoses: Certain genetic disorders interfere with DNA repair after sun exposure, thereby putting these individuals at higher risk for the development of actinic keratoses. Examples of such genetic disorders include xeroderma pigmentosum and Bloom syndrome.\n- Balding: actinic keratoses are commonly found on the scalps of balding men. The degree of baldness seems to be a risk factor for lesion development, as men with severe baldness were found to be seven times more likely to have 10 or more actinic keratoses when compared to men with minimal or no baldness. [37]  This observation can be explained by an absence of hair causing a larger proportion of scalp to be exposed to UV radiation if other sun protection measures are not taken.\n\n\n\n## Diagnosis\n\nPhysicians usually diagnose  actinic keratosis  by  doing  a  thorough  physical  examination,  through  a combination of visual observation and touch. However a biopsy may be necessary when the keratosis is large in diameter, thick, or bleeding, in order to make sure that the lesion is not a skin cancer. Actinic keratosis may progress to invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) but both diseases can present similarly upon physical exam and can be difficult to distinguish clinically. [6]\n\nHistological examination of the lesion from a biopsy or excision may be necessary to definitively distinguish actinic keratosis from in situ or invasive SCC. [6]  In addition to SCCs, actinic keratoses can be mistaken for other cutaneous lesions including seborrheic keratoses, basal cell carcinoma, lichenoid keratosis,"

[38]\n\n\n# Biopsy\n\nA lesion biopsy is performed if the diagnosis remains uncertain after a clinical physical exam, or if there is suspicion that the actinic keratosis might have progressed to squamous cell carcinoma. The most common tissue sampling techniques include shave or punch biopsy. When only a portion of the lesion can be removed due to its size or location, the biopsy  should  sample  tissue  from  the  thickest  area  of  the  lesion,  as SCCs are most likely to be detected in that area.\n\nIf a shave biopsy is performed, it should extend through to the level of the  dermis  in  order  to  provide  sufficient  tissue  for  diagnosis;  ideally,  it  would  extend  to  the  mid-reticular dermis. Punch biopsy usually extends to the subcutaneous fat when the entire length of the punch blade is utilized.\n\n\n## Histopathology\n\nOn histologic examination, actinic keratoses usually show a collection of atypical keratinocytes with hyperpigmented or pleomorphic nuclei, extending  to  the  basal  layer  of  the  epidermis.  A  \"flag  sign\"  is  often described, referring to alternating areas of orthokeratosis and parakeratosis.  Epidermal  thickening  and  surrounding  areas  of  sundamaged skin are often seen. [39]   The  normal  ordered  maturation  of the  keratinocytes  is  disordered  to  varying  degrees:  there  may  be widening of the intracellular spaces, cytologic atypia such as abnormally large nuclei, and a mild chronic inflammatory infiltrate. [8]\n\nSpecific findings depend on the clinical variant and particular lesion characteristics. The  seven  major  histopathologic  variants  are  all characterized by atypical keratinocytic proliferation beginning in the basal layer and confined to the epidermis; they include: [39]\n\n\n- Hypertrophic: Notable for marked hyperkeratosis, often with evident parakeratosis. [39]  Keratinocytes in the stratum malphigii may show a loss of polarity, pleomorphism, and anaplasia. [25]  Some irregular downward proliferation into the uppermost dermis may be observed, but does not represent frank invasion. [25]\n- Atrophic: With slight hyperkeratosis and overall atrophic changes to the epidermis; the basal layer shows cells with large, hyperchromatic nuclei in close proximity to each other. These cells have been observed to proliferate into the dermis as buds and duct-like structures. [25]\n- Lichenoid: Demonstrate a band-like lymphocytic infiltrate in the papillary dermis, directly beneath the dermal-epidermal junction. [39]\n- Achantholytic: Intercellular clefts or lacunae in the lowermost epidermal layer that result from anaplastic changes; these produce dyskeratotic cells with disrupted intercellular bridges."

        "text": "- Bowenoid: This term is controversial and usually refers to full-thickness atypia, microscopically indistinguishable from Bowen's Disease. [25]  However most dermatologists and pathologists will use it in reference to tissue samples that are notable for small foci of atypia that involve the full thickness of the epidermis, in the background of a lesion that is otherwise consistent with an actinic keratosis. [39]\n- Epidermolytic: With granular degeneration. [25]\n- Pigmented: Show pigmentation in the basal layer of the epidermis, similar to a solar lentigo. [39]\n\n\n\n## Dermoscopy\n\nDermoscopy is a noninvasive technique utilizing a handheld magnifying device coupled with a transilluminating lift. It is often used in the evaluation of cutaneous lesions but lacks the definitive diagnostic ability of biopsy-based tissue diagnosis. Histopathologic exam remains the gold standard.\n\nPolarized contact dermoscopy of actinic keratoses occasionally reveals a \"rosette sign,\" described as four white points arranged in a clover pattern, often localized to within a follicular opening. [40]  It is hypothesized that the \"rosette sign\" corresponds histologically to the changes of orthokeratosis and parakeratosis known as the \"flag sign.\" [40]\n\n\n- Non-pigmented actinic keratoses: linear or wavy vascular patterning, or a \"strawberry pattern,\" described as unfocused vessels between hair follicles, with white-haloed follicular openings. [ 41 ]\n- Pigmented actinic keratoses: gray to brown dots or globules surrounding follicular openings, and annular-granular rhomboidal structures; often difficult to differentiate from lentigo maligna. [ 42 ]\n\n\n\n## Prevention\n\n\nUltraviolet radiation is believed to contribute to the development of actinic keratoses by inducing mutations in epidermal  keratinocytes,  leading  to  proliferation  of  atypical  cells. [43]   Therefore,  preventive  measures  for actinic keratoses are targeted at limiting exposure to solar radiation, including:\n- Limiting extent of sun exposure\n- Avoid sun exposure during noontime hours between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM when UV light is most powerful\n- Minimize all time in the sun, since UV exposure occurs even in the winter and on cloudy days [44]\n- Using sun protection\n- Applying sunscreens with SPF ratings 30 or greater that also block both UVA and UVB light, at least every 2 hours and after swimming or sweating [44]\n- Applying sunscreen at least 15 minutes before going outside, as this allows time for the sunscreen to be absorbed appropriately by the skin [44]\n- Wearing sun protective clothing such as hats, sunglasses, long-sleeved shirts, long skirts, or trousers. \"Consider taking 10 micrograms of vitamin D a day if you always cover up outdoors. This is because you may not get enough vitamin D from sunlight.\" [45]\n\n\n\n## Management\n\nThere  are  a  variety  of  treatment  options  for  actinic  keratosis  depending  on  the  patient  and  the  clinical characteristics of the lesion. Actinic keratoses show a wide range of features, which guide decision-making in choosing treatment. As there are multiple effective treatments, patient preference and lifestyle are also factors that physicians consider when determining the management plan for actinic keratosis. [46]  Regular follow-up is  advisable  after  any  treatment  to  make  sure  no  new  lesions  have  developed  and  that  old  ones  are  not progressing. Adding topical treatment after a procedure may improve outcomes. [47]"

        "text": "# Medication\n\nTopical  medications  are  often  recommended  for  areas  where  multiple  or  ill-defined  actinic  keratoses  are present, as the medication can easily be used to treat a relatively large area. [46]\n\n\n## Fluorouracil cream\n\nTopical  fluorouracil  (5-FU)  destroys  actinic  keratoses  by  blocking  methylation  of  thymidylate  synthetase, thereby interrupting DNA and RNA synthesis. [48]  This in turn prevents the proliferation of dysplastic cells in AK. Topical 5-FU is the most utilized treatment for AK, and often results in effective removal of the lesion. [49] Overall, there is a 50% efficacy rate resulting in 100% clearance of actinic keratoses treated with topical 5FU. [50][51]  5-FU may be up to 90% effective in treating non-hyperkeratotic lesions. [52]  While topical 5-FU is a widely used and cost-effective treatment for actinic keratoses and is generally well tolerated, its potential sideeffects can include: pain, crusting, redness, and local swelling. [53]  These adverse effects can be mitigated or minimized by reducing the frequency of application or taking breaks between uses. [53]  The most commonly used application regimen consists of applying a layer of topical cream to the lesion twice a day after washing; duration of treatment is typically 2-4 weeks to thinner skin like the cheeks and up to 8 weeks for the arms; treatment of up to 8 weeks has demonstrated a higher cure rate. [54][55]\n\nCalcipotriol combined with 5-fluorouracil has been found to be an effective treatment. [56][57][58]\n\n\n## Imiquimod cream\n\nImiquimod is a topical immune-enhancing agent licensed for the treatment of genital warts. [25]  Imiquimod stimulates  the  immune  system  through  the  release  and  up-regulation  of  cytokines. [54]   Treatment  with Imiquimod cream applied 2-3 times per week for 12 to 16 weeks was found to result in complete resolution of actinic  keratoses  in  50%  of  people,  compared  to  5%  of  controls. [59]   The  Imiquimod  3.75%  cream  has  been validated  in  a  treatment  regimen  consisting  of  daily  application  to  entire  face  and  scalp  for  two  2-week treatment cycles, with a complete clearance rate of 36%. [60]\n\nWhile the clearance rate observed with the Imiquimod 3.75% cream was lower than that observed with the 5% cream (36 and 50 percent, respectively), there are lower reported rates of adverse reactions with the 3.75% cream: 19% of individuals using Imiquimod 3.75% cream reported adverse reactions including local erythema, scabbing, and flaking at the application site, while nearly a third of individuals using the 5% cream reported the same types of reactions with Imiquimod treatment. [59][60]  However, it is ultimately difficult to compare the efficacy of the different strength creams directly, as study data varies in methodology (e.g. duration and frequency of treatment, and amount of skin surface area covered).\n\n\n## Ingenol mebutate gel\n\nIngenol mebutate is a treatment for actinic keratosis used in Europe and the United States. It works in two ways,  first  by  disrupting  cell  membranes  and  mitochondria  resulting  cell  death,  and  then  by  inducing antibody-dependent  cellular  cytotoxicity  to  eliminate  remaining  tumor  cells. [61][62]   Treatment  with  the 0.015%  gel  was  found  to  completely  clear  57%  of  AK,  while  the  0.05%  gel  had  a  34%  clearance  rate. [63] Advantages of ingenol mebutate treatment include the short duration of therapy and a low recurrence rate. [64]\n\n\n## Diclofenac sodium gel\n\nTopical  diclofenac  sodium  gel  is  a  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drug  that  is  thought  to  work  in  the treatment  of  actinic  keratosis  through  its  inhibition  of  the  arachidonic  acid  pathway,  thereby  limiting  the production  of  prostaglandins  which  are  thought  to  be  involved  in  the  development  of  UVB-induced  skin cancers. [8]  Treatment of facial actinic keratosis with diclofenac gel led to complete lesion resolution in 40% of cases. [65]  Common side effects include dryness, itching, redness, and rash at the site of application. [65]"

[66]   Treatment  with adapalene gel daily for 4 weeks, and then twice daily thereafter for a total of nine months led to a significant but modest reduction in the number of actinic keratoses compared to placebo; it demonstrated the additional advantage of improving the appearance of photodamaged skin. [67]\n\nTopical tretinoin is ineffective as treatment for reducing the number of actinic keratoses. [25]  For secondary prevention  of  actinic  keratosis,  systemic,  low-dose  acitretin  was  found  to  be  safe,  well  tolerated  and moderately  effective  in  chemoprophylaxis  for  skin  cancers  in  kidney  transplant  patients. [68]   Acitretin  is  a viable treatment option for organ transplant patients according to expert opinion. [46]\n\n\n## Tirbanibulin\n\nTirbanibulin (Klisyri) was approved for medical use in the United States in December 2020, for the treatment of actinic keratosis on the face or scalp. [69][70][71][72]\n\n\n## Procedures\n\n\n## Cryotherapy\n\ntissue. [76]\n\n\n## Photodynamic therapy\n\nActinic  keratoses  are  one  of  the  most  common  dermatologic  lesions  for  which  photodynamic  therapy, including topical methyl aminolevulinate (MAL) or 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), is indicated. [77]\n\nTreatment  begins  with  preparation  of  the  lesion,  which  includes  scraping  away  scales  and  crusts  using  a dermal  curette.  A  thick  layer  of  topical  MAL  or  5-ALA  cream  is  applied  to  the  lesion  and  a  small  area surrounding the lesion, which is then covered with an occlusive dressing and left for a period of time. During this time the photosensitizer accumulates in the target cells within the actinic keratosis lesion. The dressings are then removed and the lesion is treated with light at a specified wavelength.\n\nLiquid  nitrogen  (-195.8  °C)  is  the  most  commonly  used  destructive therapy for the treatment of actinic keratosis in the United States. [73] It is a well-tolerated office procedure that does not require anesthesia. [74]\n\nCryotherapy is particularly indicated for cases where there are fewer than  15  thin,  well-demarcated  lesions. [73]   Caution  is  encouraged  for thicker,  more  hyperkeratotic  lesions,  as  dysplastic  cells  may  evade treatment. [55]   Treatment  with  both  cryotherapy  and  field  treatment can be considered for these more advanced lesions. [55]  Cryotherapy is generally  performed  using  an  open-spray  technique,  wherein  the actinic keratosis is sprayed for several seconds. [25]\n\nThe  process  can  be  repeated  multiple  times  in  one  office  visit,  as tolerated. Cure rates from 67 to 99 percent have been reported, [75][15] depending  on  freeze  time  and  lesion  characteristics.  Disadvantages include discomfort during and after the procedure; blistering, scarring and redness; hypo- or hyperpigmentation; and destruction of healthy"

        "text": "Multiple treatment regimens using different photosensitizers, incubation times, light sources, and pretreatment regimens have been studied and suggest that longer incubation times lead to higher rates of lesion clearance. [78]  Photodynamic therapy is gaining in popularity. It  has  been  found  to  have  a  14%  higher  likelihood  of  achieving complete lesion  clearance  at  3  months  compared  to  cryotherapy, [79] and seems to result in superior cosmetic outcomes when compared to cryotherapy  or  5-FU  treatment. [80]   Photodynamic  therapy  can  be particularly effective in treating areas with multiple actinic keratosis lesions. [81]\n\n\n# Surgical techniques\n\n\n- Surgical excision is a rarely utilized technique for actinic keratosis treatment.\n- Shave excision and curettage (sometimes followed by electrodesiccation when deemed appropriate by the physician [82][73] ): This technique is often used for treatment of actinic keratoses, and particularly for lesions appearing more similar to squamous cell carcinoma, or those that are unresponsive to other treatments. [73]  The surface of the lesion can be scraped away using a scalpel, or the base can be removed with a curette. Tissue can be evaluated histopathologically under the microscope, but specimens acquired using this technique are not often adequate to determine whether a lesion is invasive or intraepidermal.\n- Dermabrasion: Dermabrasion is useful in the treatment of large areas with multiple actinic keratosis lesions. The process involves using a hand-held instrument to \"sand\" the skin, removing the stratum corneum layer of the epidermis. Diamond fraises or wire brushes revolving at high speeds are used. [25]  The procedure can be quite painful and requires procedural sedation and anesthetic, necessitating a hospital stay. One-year clearance rates with dermabrasion treatment are as high as 96%, but diminish drastically to 54% at five years. [83]\n\n\n\n## Laser therapy\n\nLaser therapy using carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) or erbium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Er:YAG) lasers is a treatment approach  being  utilized  with  increased  frequency,  and  sometimes  in  conjunction  with  computer  scanning technology. [84]  Laser therapy has not been extensively studied, but evidence suggests it may be effective in cases  involving  multiple  actinic  keratoses  refractive  to  medical  therapy,  or  actinic  keratoses  located  in cosmetically  sensitive  locations  such  as  the  face. [85]   The  CO 2   laser  has  been  recommended  for  extensive actinic cheilitis that has not responded to 5-FU. [55]\n\n\n## Chemical peels\n\nA chemical peel is a topically applied agent that wounds the outermost layer of the skin, promoting organized repair, exfoliation, and eventually the development of smooth and rejuvenated skin. Multiple therapies have been studied. A medium-depth peel may effectively treat multiple non-hyperkeratotic actinic keratoses. [86]  It can be achieved with 35% to 50% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) alone or at 35% in combination with Jessner's solution in a once-daily application for a minimum of 3 weeks; 70% glycolic acid (α-hydroxy acid); or solid CO 2 . [87]\n\nWhen compared to treatment with 5-FU, chemical peels have demonstrated similar efficacy and increased ease of use with similar morbidity. [88]  Chemical peels must be performed in a controlled clinic environment and  are  recommended  only  for  individuals  who  are  able  to  comply  with  follow-up  precautions,  including avoidance of sun exposure. Furthermore, they should be avoided in individuals with a history of HSV infection or keloids, and in those who are immunosuppressed or who are taking photosensitizing medications."

        "text": "# Prognosis\n\nUntreated actinic keratoses follow one of three paths: they can either persist  as  actinic  keratoses,  regress,  or  progress  to  invasive  skin cancer, as actinic keratosis lesions are considered to be on the same continuum with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). [17]  Actinic keratosis lesions that regress also have the potential to recur.\n\n\n- Progression: The overall risk of an actinic keratosis turning into invasive cancer is low. In average-risk individuals, likelihood of an actinic keratosis lesion progressing to SCC is less than 1% per year. [89][90]  Despite this low rate of progression, studies suggest that a full 60% of SCCs arise from pre-existing actinic keratoses, reinforcing the idea that these lesions are closely related. [89][90]\n- Regression: Reported regression rates for single actinic keratosis lesions have ranged between 15 and 63% after one year. [91]\n- Recurrence: Recurrence rates after 1 year for single actinic keratosis lesions that have regressed range between 15 and 53%. [91]\n\n\n\n## Clinical course\n\nGiven the aforementioned differering clinical outcomes, it is difficult to predict the clinical course of any given actinic  keratosis.  Actinic  keratosis  lesions  may  also  come  and  go-in  a  cycle  of  appearing  on  the  skin, remaining for months, and then disappearing. Often they will reappear in a few weeks or months, particularly after  unprotected  sun  exposure.  Left  untreated,  there  is  a  chance  that  the  lesion  will  advance  to  become invasive. Although it is difficult to predict whether an actinic keratosis will advance to become squamous cell carcinoma, it has been noted that squamous cell carcinomas originate in lesions formerly diagnosed as actinic keratoses with frequencies reported between 65 and 97%. [17]\n\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nActinic keratosis is very common, with an estimated 14% of dermatology visits related to actinic keratoses. [92] It  is  seen  more  often  in  fair-skinned  individuals, [33]   and  rates  vary  with  geographical  location  and  age. [93] Other factors such as exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, [94] certain phenotypic features,  and immunosuppression can also contribute to the development of actinic keratoses.\n\nMen are more likely  to  develop  actinic  keratosis  than  women,  and  the  risk  of  developing  actinic  keratosis lesions  increases  with  age.  These  findings  have  been  observed  in  multiple  studies,  with  numbers  from  one study suggesting that approximately 5% of women ages 20-29 develop actinic keratosis compared to 68% of women ages 60-69, and 10% of men ages 20-29 develop actinic keratosis compared to 79% of men ages 6069. [95]\n\nGeography seems to play a role in the sense that individuals living in locations where they are exposed to more UV radiation throughout their lifetime have a significantly higher risk of developing actinic keratosis. Much of the literature on actinic keratosis comes from Australia, where the prevalence of actinic keratosis is estimated at 40-50% in adults over 40, [95]  as compared to the United States and Europe, where prevalence is estimated at under 11-38% in adults. [37][94]  One study found that those who immigrated to Australia after age 20 had fewer actinic keratoses than native Australians in all age groups. [96]"

        "text": "# Research\n\nResearch implicating human papillomavirus (HPV) in the development of actinic keratoses suggests that HPV prevention  might  in  turn  help  prevent  development  of  actinic  keratoses,  as  UV-induced  mutations  and oncogenic transformation are likely facilitated in cases of active HPV infection. [29]  A key component of HPV prevention includes vaccination. [97]\n\nThere are some data that in individuals with a history of non-melanoma skin cancer, a low-fat diet can serve as a preventative measure against future actinic keratoses. [38]\n\nDiagnostically,  researchers  are  investigating  the  role  of  novel  biomarkers  to  assist  in  determining  which actinic  keratoses  are  more  likely  to  develop  into  cutaneous  or  metastatic  SCC.  Upregulation  of  matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) is seen in many different types of cancers, and the expression and production of MMP-7  in  particular  has  been  found  to  be  elevated  in  SCC  specifically. [98]   The  role  of  serin  peptidase inhibitors (Serpins) is also being investigated. SerpinA1 was found to be elevated in the keratinocytes of SCC cell lines, and SerpinA1 upregulation was correlated with SCC tumor progression in vivo . [98]\n\nIn  terms  of  treatment,  a  number  of  medications  are  being  studied.  Resiquimod  is  a  TLR  7/8  agonist  that works similarly to imiquimod, but is 10 to 100 times more potent; when used to treat actinic keratosis lesions, complete response rates have range from 40 to 74%. [99]  Afamelanotide is a drug that induces the production of  melanin  by  melanocytes  to  act  as  a  protective  factor  against  UVB  radiation. [100]   It  is  being  studied  to determine its efficacy in preventing actinic keratoses in organ transplant patients who are on immunosuppressive therapy. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors such as gefitinib, and antiEGFR antibodies  such  as  cetuximab  are  used  in  the  treatment  of  various  types  of  cancers,  and  are  being investigated for potential use in the treatment and prevention of actinic keratoses.
