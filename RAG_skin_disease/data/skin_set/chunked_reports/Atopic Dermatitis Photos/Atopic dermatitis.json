[2]  Atopic dermatitis is  also  often  called  simply eczema but  the  same  term  is  also used to refer to dermatitis, the larger group of skin conditions. [2][5]  Atopic dermatitis results in itchy, red, swollen, and  cracked  skin. [2]   Clear  fluid  may  come  from  the  affected areas, which can thicken over time. [2]\n\nAtopic dermatitis affects about 20% of people at some point in their  lives. [2][4]   It  is  more  common  in  younger  children. [3] Females  are  affected  slightly  more  often  than  males. [6]   Many people outgrow the condition. [3]",

[25]  Even today, people who migrate from developing nations before the age of 4 years to industrialized nations experience a dramatic rise in the risk of atopic dermatitis and have an additional risk when living in urbanized areas of the industrial nation. [26]   Recent work has shed light on these and other data strongly suggesting that early life industrial exposures may cause atopic dermatitis.

[32]  The industrial manufacturing and use of both xylene and diisocyanates greatly increased starting in 1970, which greatly expanded the average exposure to these substances.

Atopy is a term used  to  describe  individuals  who  produce  substantial  amounts  of  IgE.  Such  individuals  have  an  increased tendency to develop asthma, hay fever, eczema, urticaria and allergic rhinitis. [18][19]  Up to 80% of people with atopic dermatitis have elevated total or allergen-specific IgE levels. [34]\n\nSkin barrier: About 30% of people with AD have mutations in the gene for the production of filaggrin ( FLG ), which  increases  the  risk  for  early  onset  of  atopic  dermatitis  and  developing  asthma. [35][36]   However, expression of filaggrin protein or breakdown products offer no predictive utility in atopic dermatitis risk. [29]",

[38]   This  exposure  is  limited  in  a  modern  \"sanitary\"  environment,  and  the  incorrectly  developed immune system is prone to develop allergies to harmless substances.\n\nSome support exists for this hypothesis with respect to AD. [39]  Those exposed to dogs while growing up have a lower  risk  of  atopic  dermatitis. [40]   Also,  epidemiological  studies  support  a  protective  role  for  helminths against AD.

[43]  Atopic dermatitis sometimes appears associated with coeliac disease and non-coeliac gluten sensitivity. Because a gluten-free diet (GFD) improves symptoms in these cases, gluten seems to be the cause of AD in these cases. [44][45]  A diet high in fruits seems to have a protective effect against AD, whereas the opposite seems true for heavily processed foods. [41]",

[34] Disruptions of the epidermal barrier allows allergens to penetrate the epidermis to deeper layers of the skin. This leads to activation of epidermal inflammatory dendritic and innate lymphoid cells, which subsequently attract Th2 CD4+ helper T cells to the skin. [34]  This dysregulated Th2 inflammatory response is thought to lead  to  the  eczematous  lesions.

The active Jak pathways lead to inflammation and downstream activation of plasma cells and B lymphocytes, which release antigen-specific IgE, contributing to further inflammation.

All of the different types of moisturisers are equally effective, so people need to choose one or more products based on what suits them, according to their age, body site affected, climate/season, and personal preference. [67]  Non-medicated prescription moisturisers may also be no more effective than overthe-counter moisturisers. [68]\n\nThe use of emollient bath additives does not provide any additional benefits.

[2]  Atopic dermatitis is  also  often  called  simply eczema but  the  same  term  is  also used to refer to dermatitis, the larger group of skin conditions. [2][5]  Atopic dermatitis results in itchy, red, swollen, and  cracked  skin. [2]   Clear  fluid  may  come  from  the  affected areas, which can thicken over time. [2]\n\nAtopic dermatitis affects about 20% of people at some point in their  lives. [2][4]   It  is  more  common  in  younger  children. [3] Females  are  affected  slightly  more  often  than  males. [6]   Many people outgrow the condition. [3]\n\nWhile the condition may occur at any age, it typically begins in childhood, with varying severity over the years. [2][3]  In children under one year of age, the face and limbs and much of the body may  be  affected. [3]   As  children  get  older,  the  areas  on  the insides of the knees and folds of the elbows and around the neck are most commonly affected. [3]  In adults, the hands and feet are commonly affected. [3]  Scratching the affected areas worsens the eczema and increases the risk of skin infections. [2]  Many people with atopic dermatitis develop hay fever or asthma. [2]\n\nThe  cause  is  unknown  but  is  believed  to  involve  genetics, immune  system  dysfunction,  environmental  exposures,  and difficulties with the permeability of the skin. [2][3] If  one identical twin is affected, the other has an 85% chance of having the  condition. [7]   Those  who  live  in  cities  and  dry  climates  are more  commonly  affected. [2]   Exposure  to  certain  chemicals  or frequent hand washing makes symptoms worse. [2] While emotional  stress  may  make  the  symptoms  worse,  it  is  not  a cause. [2] The  disorder  is not  contagious. [2]   A  diagnosis  is typically based on the signs, symptoms, and family history. [3]\n\nTreatment  involves  avoiding  things  that  make  the  condition worse,  enhancing  the  skin  barrier  through  skin  care,  and treating the underlying skin inflammation. Moisturising creams are  used  to  make  the  skin  less  dry  and  prevent  AD  flare-ups. Anti-inflammatory  corticosteroid  creams  are  used  to  control flare-ups. [3]  Creams based on calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus or  pimecrolimus)  may  also  be  used  to  control  flares  if  other measures  are  not  effective. [2][8]   Certain  antihistamine  pills might  help  with  itchiness. [3]   Things  that  commonly  make  it worse  include  house  dust  mite,  stress  and  seasonal  factors.

[1]\n\n\n# Signs and symptoms\n\nSymptoms refer to the sensations that people with AD feel, whereas signs refer to a description of the visible changes that result from AD.\n\nThe  main  symptom  of  AD  is  itching  which  can  be  intense.  Some people experience burning, soreness, or pain. [2]\n\n\nPeople with AD often have generally dry skin that can look greyish in people  of  colour  with  darker  skin  tones.  Areas  of  AD  are  not  welldefined, and they are typically inflamed (red in light coloured skin and purple  or  dark  brown  in  dark  coloured  skin). [12]   Surface  changes include:\n- scaling cracking (skin fissures)\n- swelling (oedema)\n- scratch marks (excoriation)\n- bumpiness (papulation)\n- oozing of clear fluid\n- thickening of the skin (lichenification) where the AD has been present for a long time. [ 2 ]\n\n\nEczema often starts on the cheeks and outer limbs and body in infants and  frequently  settles  in  the  folds  of  the  skin,  such  as  behind  the knees,  folds  of  the  elbows,  around  the  neck,  wrists,  and  under  the buttock  folds  as  the  child  grows. [13]   Any  part  of  the  body  can  be affected by AD. [14]\n\nAtopic  dermatitis  commonly  affects  the  eyelids,  where  an  extra prominent  crease  can  form  under  the  eyelid  due  to  skin  swelling known as Dennie-Morgan infraorbital folds. [15]  Cracks can form under the ears, which can be painful (infra-auricular fissure). [16][15]\n\nThe inflammation from AD often leaves \"footprints\" known as postinflammatory pigmentation that can be lighter  than  the  normal  skin  or  darker.  These  marks  are  not  scars  and  eventually  go  back  to  normal  over months, provided the underlying AD is treated effectively. [17]\n\nPeople with AD often have dry and scaly skin that spans the entire body, except perhaps the diaper area, and intensely itchy red, splotchy, raised lesions to form  in the bends  of the arms  or legs, face,  and neck. [18][19][20][21][22]\n\n\n## Causes\n\nThe cause of AD is not known, although evidence indicates environmental, immunologic, bacterial [23]   and potential genetic factors. [24]"

        "text": "# Pollution\n\nSince 1970, the rates of atopic dermatitis in the US and UK have increased 3-6 fold. [25]  Even today, people who migrate from developing nations before the age of 4 years to industrialized nations experience a dramatic rise in the risk of atopic dermatitis and have an additional risk when living in urbanized areas of the industrial nation. [26]   Recent work has shed light on these and other data strongly suggesting that early life industrial exposures may cause atopic dermatitis. [25][27]  Chemicals such as (di)isocyanates and xylene prevent the skin bacteria  from  producing  ceramide-sphingolipid  family  lipids. [25][27]   Early  life  deficiency  in  these  lipids predicts  which  children  will  go  on  to  develop  atopic  dermatitis. [28][29][30][31]   These  chemicals  also  directly activate an itch receptor in the skin known as TRPA1. [32]  The industrial manufacturing and use of both xylene and diisocyanates greatly increased starting in 1970, which greatly expanded the average exposure to these substances. For example, these chemicals are components of several exposures known to increase the risk of atopic dermatitis or worsen symptoms including: wildfires, automobile exhaust, wallpaper adhesives, paints, non-latex foam furniture, cigarette smoke, and are elements of fabrics like polyester, nylon,  and spandex. [26][25][27]\n\n\n## Climate\n\nLow  humidity,  and  low  temperature  increase  the  prevalence  and  risk  of  flares  in  people  with  atopic dermatitis. [33]\n\n\n## Genetics\n\nGenes that may contribute to AD are mainly those responsible for immune response (e.g., TH2 cytokine and JAK-STAT pathway genes) and skin barrier (e.g., filaggrin, claudin-1, loricrin).\n\nImmune response: Many people with AD have a family history or a personal history of atopy. Atopy is a term used  to  describe  individuals  who  produce  substantial  amounts  of  IgE.  Such  individuals  have  an  increased tendency to develop asthma, hay fever, eczema, urticaria and allergic rhinitis. [18][19]  Up to 80% of people with atopic dermatitis have elevated total or allergen-specific IgE levels. [34]\n\nSkin barrier: About 30% of people with AD have mutations in the gene for the production of filaggrin ( FLG ), which  increases  the  risk  for  early  onset  of  atopic  dermatitis  and  developing  asthma. [35][36]   However, expression of filaggrin protein or breakdown products offer no predictive utility in atopic dermatitis risk. [29]\n\nPeople  with  atopic  dermatitis  also  have  decreased  expression  of  tight  junction  protein  Claudin-1,  which deteriorates the bioelectric barrier function in the epidermis. [37]\n\n\n## Hygiene hypothesis\n\nAccording to the hygiene hypothesis, early childhood exposure to certain microorganisms (such as gut flora and helminth parasites) protects against allergic diseases by contributing to the development of the immune system. [38]   This  exposure  is  limited  in  a  modern  \"sanitary\"  environment,  and  the  incorrectly  developed immune system is prone to develop allergies to harmless substances.\n\nSome support exists for this hypothesis with respect to AD. [39]  Those exposed to dogs while growing up have a lower  risk  of  atopic  dermatitis. [40]   Also,  epidemiological  studies  support  a  protective  role  for  helminths against AD. [41]  Likewise, children with poor hygiene are at a lower risk for developing AD, as are children who drink unpasteurized milk. [41]\n\n\n## Allergens\n\nIn a small percentage of cases, atopic dermatitis is caused by sensitization to foods [42]  such as milk, but there is growing consensus that food allergy most likely arises as a result of skin barrier dysfunction resulting from AD, rather than food allergy causing the skin problems. [43]  Atopic dermatitis sometimes appears associated with coeliac disease and non-coeliac gluten sensitivity. Because a gluten-free diet (GFD) improves symptoms in these cases, gluten seems to be the cause of AD in these cases. [44][45]  A diet high in fruits seems to have a protective effect against AD, whereas the opposite seems true for heavily processed foods. [41]"

        "text": "Exposure  to  allergens,  either  from  food  or  the  environment,  can  exacerbate  existing  atopic  dermatitis. [46] Exposure to dust mites, for example, is believed to contribute to the risk of developing AD. [47]\n\n\n# Hard water\n\nThe prevalence of atopic dermatitis in children may be linked to the level of calcium carbonate or \"hardness\" of household drinking water. [48][49]  Living in areas with hard water may also play a part in the development of AD in early life. However, when AD is already established, using water softeners at home does not reduce the severity of the symptoms. [49][50]\n\n\n## Role of Staphylococcus aureus\n\nColonization  of  the  skin  by  the  bacterium S.  aureus is  prevalent  in  those  with  atopic  dermatitis. [51] Abnormalities in the skin barrier of persons with AD are exploited by S. aureus to trigger cytokine expression, thus aggravating the condition. [52]\n\nHowever,  atopic  dermatitis  is  non-communicable  and  therefore  could  not  be  directly  caused  by  a  highly infectious  organism.  Furthermore,  there  is  insufficient  evidence  for  the  effectiveness  of  anti-staphylococcal treatments for treating S. aureus in infected or uninfected eczema. [53]\n\nThe role of S. aureus in skin irritation occurs via inflammation factors that induce itching, which may damage the  skin,  further  driving  inflammation,  and  facilitating  the  growth  of S.  aureus ,  thus  promoting  a  chronic cycle. [54]\n\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nExcessive type 2 inflammation underlies the pathophysiology of atopic dermatitis. [55][56]\n\nDisruption  of  the  epidermal  barrier  is  thought  to  play  an  integral  role  in  the  pathogenesis  of  AD. [34] Disruptions of the epidermal barrier allows allergens to penetrate the epidermis to deeper layers of the skin. This leads to activation of epidermal inflammatory dendritic and innate lymphoid cells, which subsequently attract Th2 CD4+ helper T cells to the skin. [34]  This dysregulated Th2 inflammatory response is thought to lead  to  the  eczematous  lesions. [34]   The  Th2  helper  T  cells  become  activated,  leading  to  the  release  of inflammatory  cytokines  including  IL-4,  IL-13  and  IL-31  which  activate  downstream  Janus  kinase  (Jak) pathways. The active Jak pathways lead to inflammation and downstream activation of plasma cells and B lymphocytes, which release antigen-specific IgE, contributing to further inflammation. [34]  Other CD4+ helper T-cell  pathways thought to be involved in atopic dermatitis inflammation include the Th1, Th17, and Th22 pathways. [34]   Some  specific  CD4+  helper  T-cell  inflammatory  pathways  are  more  commonly  activated  in specific ethnic groups with AD (for example, the Th-2 and Th-17 pathways are commonly activated in Asian people)  possibly  explaining  the  differences  in  phenotypic  presentation  of  atopic  dermatitis  in  specific populations. [34]\n\nMutations  in  the  filaggrin  gene, FLG ,  also  cause  impairment  in  the  skin  barrier  that  contributes  to  the pathogenesis of AD. [34]  Filaggrin is produced by epidermal skin cells (keratinocytes) in the horny layer of the epidermis.  Filaggrin  stimulates  skin  cells  to  release  moisturizing  factors  and  lipid  matrix  material,  which cause adhesion of adjacent keratinocytes and contribute to the skin barrier. [34]  A loss-of-function mutation of filaggrin causes loss of this lipid matrix and external moisturizing factors, subsequently leading to disruption of the skin barrier. The disrupted skin barrier leads to transdermal water loss (leading to the xerosis or dry skin  commonly  seen  in  AD)  and  antigen  and  allergen  penetration  of  the  epidermal  layer. [34]   Filaggrin mutations  are  also  associated  with  a  decrease  in  natural  antimicrobial  peptides  found  on  the  skin; subsequently leading to disruption of skin flora and bacterial overgrowth (commonly Staphylococcus aureus overgrowth or colonization).

        "text": "Atopic  dermatitis  is  also  associated  with  the  release  of  pruritogens  (molecules  that  stimulate  pruritus  or itching)  in  the  skin. [34]   Keratinocytes,  mast  cells,  eosinophils  and  T-cells  release  pruritogens  in  the  skin; leading  to  activation  of  Aδ  fibers  and  Group  C  nerve  fibers  in  the  epidermis  and  dermis  contributing  to sensations of pruritus and pain. [34]  The pruritogens include the Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-13, IL-31, histamine, and various neuropeptides. [34]  Mechanical stimulation from scratching lesions can also lead to the release of pruritogens contributing to the itch-scratch cycle, whereby there is increased pruritus or itch after scratching a  lesion. [34]   Chronic  scratching  of  lesions  can  cause  thickening  or  lichenification  of  the  skin  or  prurigo nodularis (generalized nodules that are severely itchy). [34]\n\nAnother factor in the barrier failure and immunological dysregulation in people with atopic dermatitis may be due to decreases in tight junction protein Claudin-1. Inhibiting Claudin-1 expression in human keratinocytes has been shown to both reduce tight junction function, as well as increase keratinocyte proliferation in vitro. It has also been discovered that this deteriorates the bioelectric barrier function in the epidermis. [37]\n\n\n# Diagnosis\n\nAtopic dermatitis is typically diagnosed clinically, meaning it is based on signs and symptoms alone, without special  testing. [57]   Several  different  criteria  developed  for  research  have  also  been  validated  to  aid  in diagnosis. [58]  Of these, the UK Diagnostic Criteria, based on the work of Hanifin and Rajka, has been the most widely validated. [58][59]\n\nUK diagnostic criteria [59]\n\n\n| People must have itchy skin, or evidence of rubbing or scratching, plus three or more of:                                                                               |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Skin creases are involved - flexural dermatitis of fronts of ankles, antecubital fossae, popliteal fossae, skin around eyes, or neck, (or cheeks for children under 10) |\n| History of asthma or allergic rhinitis (or family history of these conditions if the patient is a child ≤4 years old)                                                   |\n| Symptoms began before age 2 (can only be applied to people ≥4 years old)                                                                                                |\n| History of dry skin (within the past year)                                                                                                                              |\n| Dermatitis is visible on flexural surfaces (people ≥ age 4) or on the cheeks, forehead, and extensor surfaces (people < age 4)                                          |\n\n\nOther diseases  that  must  be  excluded  before  making  a  diagnosis  include  contact  dermatitis,  psoriasis,  and seborrheic dermatitis. [3]\n\n\n## Prevention\n\nThere  are  no  established  clinical  methods  using  dietary  or  topical  strategies  to  inhibit  or  prevent  atopic dermatitis. Specific dietary plans during pregnancy and in early childhood, such as eating fatty fish (or taking omega-3 supplements), are not effective. [60]  Taking probiotics (for example Lactobacillus rhamnosus ) during pregnancy and feeding probiotics to infants are strategies under research, with only preliminary evidence that they may be preventative. [61][62]\n\nUsing moisturizers daily in infants during the first year of life does not help to prevent atopic dermatitis, and might even increase the risk of skin infections. [50][63]"

        "text": "# Treatments\n\nNo cure for AD is known, although treatments may reduce the severity and frequency of flares. [18]  The most commonly  used  topical  treatments  for  AD  are  topical  corticosteroids  (to  get  control  of  flare-ups)  and moisturisers (emollients) to help keep control. [64]  Clinical trials often measure the efficacy of treatments with a severity scale such as the SCORAD index or the Eczema Area and Severity Index. [57][65]\n\n\n## Moisturisers\n\nDaily  basic  care  stabilizes  the  barrier  function  of  the  skin  to  mitigate  its  sensitivity  to  irritation  and penetration  of  allergens.  Affected  persons  often  report  that  improvement  in  skin  hydration  parallels improvement  in  AD  symptoms.  Moisturisers  (or  emollients)  can  improve  skin  comfort  and  may  reduce disease  flares. [66]   They  can  be  used  as  leave-on  treatments,  bath  additives,  or  soap  substitutes.  There  are many different products, but the majority of leave-on treatments (least to most greasy) are lotions, creams, gels or ointments. All of the different types of moisturisers are equally effective, so people need to choose one or more products based on what suits them, according to their age, body site affected, climate/season, and personal preference. [67]  Non-medicated prescription moisturisers may also be no more effective than overthe-counter moisturisers. [68]\n\nThe use of emollient bath additives does not provide any additional benefits. [50][69][70]\n\n\n## Medication\n\n\n## Topical\n\nCreams and ointments containing corticosteroids applied directly on skin (topical) are effective in managing atopic  dermatitis. [68][71]   Newer  (second  generation)  corticosteroids,  such  as  fluticasone  propionate  and mometasone furoate, are more effective and safer than older ones. Strong and moderate corticosteroids are more  effective  than  weaker  ones.  They  are  also  generally  safe  and  do  not  cause  skin  thinning  when  used intermittently  to  treat  AD  flare-ups.  They  are  also  safe  when  used  twice  a  week  for  preventing  flares  (also known  as  weekend  treatment). [72][68][73]   Applying  once  daily  is  as  effective  as  twice  or  more  daily application. [71]\n\nIn addition to topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus, are also  recommended  as  first-line  therapies  for  managing  atopic  dermatitis. [68][74]   Both  tacrolimus  and pimecrolimus are effective and safe to use in AD. [75][76]  Crisaborole, an inhibitor of PDE-4, is also effective and  safe  as  a  topical  treatment  for  mild-to-moderate  AD. [77][78]   Ruxolitinib,  a  Janus  kinase  inhibitor,  has uncertain efficacy and safety. [68][74]\n\n\n## Systemic\n\nWhen topical  (on  skin)  treatments  fail  to  control  severe  AD  flares,  medications  taken  by  mouth  (systemic treatment) can be used. [50]\n\nConventional oral medications for AD  include systemic immunosuppressants, such as ciclosporin, methotrexate,  azathioprine,  and  mycophenolate. [79][80][81][50]   Antidepressants  and  antihistamine  may  be used to control pruritus (itchiness). [82]\n\nNewer  medications,  such  as  monoclonal  antibodies  and  JAK  inhibitors,  are  highly  effective  for  managing atopic  dermatitis,  but  modestly  increase  the  risk  of  conjunctivitis.  These  include  dupilumab  (Dupixent), tralokinumab (Adtralza, Adbry), abrocitinib (Cibinqo), baricitinib (Olumiant) and upadacitinib (Rinvoq). [79][74][83]   Among  monoclonal  antibodies,  dupilumab  and  tralokinumab  are  approved  to  treat moderate-to-severe eczema in the US and the EU. [84][85][86][87]  Lebrikizumab is also approved in the EU for treating moderate-to-severe AD [88]  but in the US its approval was declined due to manufacturing issues. [89] Abrocitinib  and  upadacitinib  have  also  been  approved  in  the  US  for  the  treatment  of  moderate-to-severe eczema. [90][91]  Nemolizumab (Nemluvio) was approved to treat atopic dermatitis in December 2024. [92]"

        "text": "Allergen immunotherapy may be effective in relieving symptoms of AD, but it also comes with an increased risk  of  adverse  events. [93]   This  treatment  consists  of  a  series  of  injections  or  drops  under  the  tongue  of  a solution containing the allergen. [94]\n\nThe skin of people with AD can easily get infected, most commonly by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus. Signs  of  this  include  oozing  fluid,  a  yellow  crust  on  the  skin,  worsening  eczema  symptoms  and  fever. Antibiotics  are  commonly  used  to  target  overgrowth  of S.  aureus ,  but  their  benefit  is  limited,  and  they increase the risk of antimicrobial resistance. For these reasons, they are only recommended for people who not only present symptoms on the skin but also feel systemically unwell. [50][53][95]\n\n\n# Diet\n\nThe  role  of  vitamin  D  on  atopic  dermatitis  is  not  clear,  but  vitamin  D  supplementation  may  improve  its symptoms. [96][97][98]\n\nThere  is  no  clear  benefit  for  pregnant  mothers  taking  omega  3  long-chain  polyunsaturated  fatty  acid (LCPUFA) in preventing the development of AD in their child. [99][100]\n\nSeveral probiotics seem to have a positive effect, with a roughly 20% reduction in the rate of AD. [101][102][103] Probiotics containing multiple strains of bacteria seem to work the best. [104]\n\nIn people with celiac disease or nonceliac gluten sensitivity, a gluten-free diet improves their symptoms and prevents the occurrence of new outbreaks. [44][45]\n\nUse of blood-specific IgE or skin prick tests to guide dietary exclusions to improve disease severity or control is controversial. Clinicians vary in their use of these tests for this purpose, and there is very limited evidence of any benefit. [105]\n\n\n## Lifestyle\n\nHealth professionals often recommend that people with AD bathe regularly in lukewarm baths, especially in saltwater,  to  moisten  their  skin. [19][106]   Dilute  bleach  baths  may  be  helpful  for  people  with  moderate  and severe eczema, but only for people with Staphylococcus aureus. [107]\n\nAvoiding large-diameter woolen clothing or scratchy fibres is usually recommended for people with AD as they can trigger a flare. [108][109]  Safe alternatives are clothes made from fabrics with smaller diameters and smooth fibers. These include super- and ultrafine merino wool and fabrics with anti-microbial textile finishes. Wearing silk is also safe but does not improve symptoms of AD. [108][50][110]\n\n\n## Self-management\n\nLiving with AD requires a high level of self-management (for example, avoiding triggers) and adherence to treatments  (regularly  applying  medication).  Good  self-management  contributes  to  better  disease  outcomes and quality of life. [111][112]   However,  worries  about  topical  treatments,  misconceptions  about  the  condition, unclear information, and unsuitable communication from doctors can make living with AD more difficult. [50]\n\nPeople with AD often do not regard eczema as a long-term condition and hope they will outgrow or cure it. This can cause worse adherence to the necessary long-term treatment. Doctors should not imply that it is a short-term  condition  and  should  emphasise  that  even  though  it  cannot  be  cured,  it  can  be  controlled effectively. [113][112]"

        "text": "Appropriate communication from doctors can support self-management. Doctors need to address concerns about  treatments  and  provide  clear  and  consistent  information  about  the  condition. [113][112]   Treatment regimens can be confusing, and written action plans may support people in knowing which treatments to use where and when. [114]  A website supporting self-management has been shown to improve AD symptoms for parents, children, adolescents and young adults. [115][116]\n\n\n# Light\n\nPhototherapic  treatment  involves  exposure  to  broad-  or  narrow-band  ultraviolet  (UV)  light.  UV  radiation exposure has been found to have a localized immunomodulatory effect on affected tissues and may be used to decrease  the  severity  and  frequency  of  flares. [117][118]   Among  the  different  types  of  phototherapies  only narrowband (NB) ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure might help with the severity of AD and ease itching. [83][119] However, UV radiation has also been implicated in various types of skin cancer, and thus UV treatment is not without risk. [120]  UV phototherapy is not indicated in young adults and children due to this risk of skin cancer with prolonged use or exposure. [34]\n\n\n## Alternative medicine\n\nWhile several Chinese herbal medicines are intended for treating atopic eczema, there is no evidence showing that  these  treatments,  taken  by  mouth  or  applied  topically,  reduce  the  severity  of  eczema  in  children  or adults. [121]  Research into microbiome-based approaches to restoring the skin barrier has also been explored, including  formulations  developed  by  companies  such  as  Codex  Labs,  which  focus  on  supporting  skin microbiota balance in atopic dermatitis. [122]\n\n\n## Impact\n\nAtopic  dermatitis  significantly  impairs  the  quality  of  life  of  affected  individuals. [123][124]   The  impact  of  AD extends beyond physical symptoms, encompassing substantial humanistic and psychosocial effects. Its burden is significant, especially given the high indirect costs and psychological impacts on quality of life. [123][125]\n\nAccording to the Global Burden of Disease Study, AD is the skin disease with the highest disability-adjusted life  year  burden  and  ranks  in  the  top  15  of  all  nonfatal  diseases.  In  comparison  with  other  dermatological conditions like psoriasis and urticaria, AD presents a significantly higher burden. [124]\n\nWhile AD remains incurable, reducing its severity can significantly alleviate its burden. Understanding the extent of the burden of AD can aid in better resource allocation and prioritization of interventions, benefiting both people with atopic dermatitis and healthcare systems. [126]\n\n\n## Humanistic burden\n\nAtopic dermatitis significantly decreases the quality of life by affecting various aspects of people's lives. The psychological impact, often resulting in conditions like depression and anxiety, is a major factor leading to decreased quality of life. Sleep disturbances, commonly reported in people with AD, further contribute to the humanistic burden, affecting daily productivity and concentration. [123]\n\n\n## Clinical and economic burden\n\nEconomically,  AD  imposes  a  substantial  burden  on  healthcare  systems,  with  the  average  direct  cost  per patient estimated at US $4411 and the average indirect cost reaching US $9068 annually. [123]  These figures highlight  the  considerable  financial  impact  of  the  disease  on  healthcare  systems  and  people  with  the condition. [127][128]"

        "text": "# Productivity loss\n\nAtopic dermatitis also has a marked impact on productivity. The total number of days lost annually due to these factors is about 68.8 days for the general AD population, with presenteeism accounting for the majority of these days. [123]  The impact on productivity varies significantly with the severity of AD, with more severe cases resulting in higher numbers of days lost. [123][129]\n\n\n## Burden of disease in the Middle East and Africa\n\nAtopic dermatitis leads to the highest loss in disability-adjusted life years compared to other skin diseases in the Middle East and Africa. [130]  Patients with AD in these regions lose approximately 0.19 quality-adjusted life years  (QALYs)  annually  due  to  the  disease.  Egypt  experiences  the  highest  QALY  loss  and  Kuwait  the lowest. [130]\n\nThe average annual healthcare cost per patient varies, is highest in the United Arab Emirates, estimated at US $3569, and lowest in Algeria at US $312. These costs are influenced by the economic status of each country and the cost of healthcare. Advanced treatments like targeted therapies and phototherapy are among the main cost drivers. [130]\n\nIndirect costs, primarily due to productivity loss from absenteeism and presenteeism, average about 67% in these countries. Indirect costs in Saudi Arabia are the highest in the area, estimated at US $364 million. [130] Factors like mental health impact, side effects of treatments, and other indirect costs, such as personal care products,  are  not  fully  accounted  for  in  these  estimates,  suggesting  that  the  actual  burden  might  be  even higher. [130]\n\nTo mitigate the burden of AD, experts recommend strategic actions across five key domains: capacity building, guidelines, research, public awareness, and patient support and education. Key measures include increasing the  number  of  dermatologists,  establishing  evidence-based  treatment  guidelines,  investing  in  patient education,  and  enhancing  public  awareness  to  reduce  stigma. [131]   Improving  access  to  effective  treatments and conducting further research on AD's impact are also crucial for reducing the disease's clinical, economic, and humanistic burdens in the MEA. [131]\n\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nSince the beginning of the 20th century, many inflammatory skin disorders have become more common; AD is a classic example of such a disease. Although AD was previously considered primarily a childhood disease, it is now recognized as highly prevalent in adults, with an estimated adult prevalence of 3-5% globally. [123][124] It now affects 15-30% of children and 2-10% of adults in developed countries, and in the United States has nearly tripled in the past 30-40 years. [19][132]  Over 15 million American adults and children have AD. [133]\n\n\n## Society and culture\n\n\n## Conspiracy theories\n\nA number of false and conspiratorial claims about AD have emerged on the internet and have been amplified by  social  media.  These  conspiracy  theories  include,  among  others,  claims  that  AD  is  caused  by  5G, formaldehyde in food, vaccines, and topical steroids. Various unproven theories also claim that vegan diets, apple cider vinegar, calendula, and witch hazel can cure AD and that air purifiers reduce the risk of developing AD. [134]"
