[4]  The severity of hair loss can vary from a small area to the entire body. [7]  Inflammation or scarring is not usually present. [4] Hair loss in some people causes psychological distress. [3]\n\nCommon  types  include  male-  or  female-pattern  hair  loss, alopecia  areata,  and  a  thinning  of  hair  known  as  telogen effluvium. [4] The cause of male-pattern hair loss is a combination  of  genetics  and  male  hormones;  the  cause  of female pattern hair loss is unclear; the cause of alopecia areata is autoimmune; and the cause of telogen effluvium is typically a physically or psychologically stressful event. [4] Telogen effluvium is very common following pregnancy. [4]",

It  occurs,  most frequently, by the growth of vellus hair in areas of the body that normally produce terminal hair. Typically, the individual's hair growth is normal after birth, but shortly thereafter the hair is shed and replaced with sparse, abnormal hair growth. The new hair is typically fine, short and brittle, and may lack pigmentation. Baldness may be present by the time the subject is 25 years old. [8]",

        "text": "# Signs and symptoms\n\nSymptoms of hair loss include hair loss in patches usually in circular patterns, dandruff,  skin  lesions,  and  scarring.  Alopecia  areata  (mild  -  medium  level) usually shows in unusual hair loss areas, e.g., eyebrows, backside of the head or above the ears, areas the male pattern baldness usually does not affect. In male-pattern hair loss, loss and thinning begin at the temples and the crown and hair  either  thins  out  or  falls  out.  Female-pattern  hair  loss  occurs  at  the frontal and parietal.\n\nPeople have between 100,000 and 150,000 hairs on their head. The number of strands  normally  lost  in  a  day  varies  but  on  average  is  100. [9]   In  order  to maintain a normal volume, hair must be replaced at the same rate at which it is  lost.  The  first  signs  of  hair  thinning  that  people will often notice are more hairs  than  usual  left  in  the  hairbrush  after  brushing  or  in  the  basin  after shampooing. Styling can also reveal areas of thinning, such as a wider parting or a thinning crown.\n\n\n## Skin conditions",

The most severe form of the condition, cystic acne, arises from the same hormonal imbalances that cause hair loss and is associated with dihydrotestosterone production. [11]\n\n\n## Psychological\n\nThe psychology of hair thinning is a complex issue. Hair is considered an essential part of overall identity: especially for women, for whom it often represents femininity and attractiveness. Men typically associate a  full  head  of  hair  with  youth  and  vigor.  People  experiencing  hair thinning  often  find  themselves  in  a  situation  where  their  physical appearance is at odds with their own self-image and commonly worry that  they  appear  older  than  they  are  or  less  attractive  to  others. Psychological problems due to baldness, if present, are typically most severe at the onset of symptoms. [12]\n\nHair loss induced by cancer chemotherapy has been reported to cause changes in self-concept and body image. Body image does not return to the previous state after regrowth of hair for a majority of patients. In  such  cases,  patients  have  difficulties  expressing  their  feelings (alexithymia)  and  may  be  more  prone  to  avoiding  family  conflicts.",

[15]  Any that affect the body's hormone balance can have a pronounced effect: these include the contraceptive pill, hormone replacement therapy, steroids and acne medications.

In addition, rigorous brushing and heat styling, rough scalp massage can damage the cuticle, the hard outer casing of the hair. This causes individual strands to become weak and break off, reducing overall hair volume.\n- Frictional alopecia is hair loss caused by rubbing of the hair or follicles, most infamously around the ankles of men from socks, where even if socks are no longer worn, the hair often will not grow back.\n- Trichotillomania is the loss of hair caused by compulsive pulling and bending of the hairs. Onset of this disorder tends to begin around the onset of puberty and usually continues through adulthood. Due to the constant extraction of the hair roots, permanent hair loss can occur.\n- Traumas such as childbirth, major surgery, poisoning, and severe stress may cause a hair loss condition known as telogen effluvium, [ 19 ] in which a large number of hairs enter the resting phase at the same time, causing shedding and subsequent thinning. The condition also presents as a side effect of chemotherapy - while targeting dividing cancer cells, this treatment also affects hair's growth phase with the result that almost 90% of hairs fall out soon after chemotherapy starts.

Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder also known as \"spot baldness\" that can result in hair loss ranging from just one location (Alopecia areata monolocularis) to every hair on the entire body (Alopecia areata universalis).

In most cases the condition corrects itself, but it can also spread to the entire scalp (alopecia totalis) or to the entire body (alopecia universalis).\n- Skin diseases and cancer . Localized or diffuse hair loss may also occur in cicatricial alopecia (lupus erythematosus, lichen plano pilaris, folliculitis decalvans, central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia, postmenopausal frontal fibrosing alopecia, etc.). Tumours and skin outgrowths also induce localized baldness (sebaceous nevus, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma).

Temporary loss of hair can occur in areas where sebaceous cysts are present for considerable duration (normally one to several weeks).\n- Congenital triangular alopecia - It is a triangular, or oval in some cases, shaped patch of hair loss in the temple area of the scalp that occurs mostly in young children. The affected area mainly contains vellus hair follicles or no hair follicles at all, but it does not expand. Its causes are unknown, and although it is a permanent condition, it does not have any other effect on the affected individuals. [25]\n- Hair growth conditions . Gradual thinning of hair with age is a natural condition known as involutional alopecia. This is caused by an increasing number of hair follicles switching from the growth, or anagen, phase into a resting phase, or telogen phase, so that remaining hairs become shorter and fewer in number.

If more than ten hairs are obtained, the pull test is considered positive. [29]\n- The pluck test is conducted by pulling hair out \"by the roots\". The root of the plucked hair is examined under a microscope to determine the phase of growth, and is used to diagnose a defect of telogen, anagen, or systemic disease. Telogen hairs have tiny bulbs without sheaths at their roots. Telogen effluvium shows an increased percentage of hairs upon examination. Anagen hairs have sheaths attached to their roots. Anagen effluvium shows a decrease in telogen-phase hairs and an increased number of broken hairs.\n- Scalp biopsy is used when the diagnosis is unsure; a biopsy allows for differing between scarring and nonscarring forms.

Finasteride causes an increase in hair retention, the weight of hair, and some increase in regrowth. Side effects in about 2% of males include decreased sex drive, erectile dysfunction, and ejaculatory dysfunction. Treatment should be continued as long as positive results occur.

These procedures are generally chosen by those who are self-conscious about their hair loss, but they are expensive and painful, with a risk of infection and scarring. Once surgery has occurred, six to eight months are needed before the quality of new hair can be assessed.\n- Scalp reduction is the process of decreasing of the area of bald skin on the head. In time, the skin on the head becomes flexible and stretched enough that some of it can be surgically removed. After the hairless scalp is removed, the space is closed with hair-covered scalp. Scalp reduction is generally done in combination with hair transplantation to provide a natural-looking hairline, especially those with extensive hair loss.\n- Hairline lowering can sometimes be used to lower a high hairline secondary to hair loss, although there may be a visible scar after further hair loss.\n- Wigs are an alternative to medical and surgical treatment; some patients wear a wig or hairpiece.

[39]  There are generally only minor side effects from scalp cooling given during chemotherapy.

[43]  Male celebrities then continued to bring  mainstream  popularity  to  shaved  heads, [44][45][46]   including athletes  such  as  Michael  Jordan [47]   and  Zinedine  Zidane  and  actors such as Dwayne Johnson, [48] Ben Kingsley, [49] and Jason Statham.

Aging of the hair follicle appears to be primed by a sustained cellular response to the DNA damage that accumulates in renewing stem cells during aging.

        "text": "# Hair loss\n\nHair loss ,  also  known  as alopecia or baldness ,  refers  to  a loss of hair from part of the head or body. [2]  Typically at least the head is involved. [4]  The severity of hair loss can vary from a small area to the entire body. [7]  Inflammation or scarring is not usually present. [4] Hair loss in some people causes psychological distress. [3]\n\nCommon  types  include  male-  or  female-pattern  hair  loss, alopecia  areata,  and  a  thinning  of  hair  known  as  telogen effluvium. [4] The cause of male-pattern hair loss is a combination  of  genetics  and  male  hormones;  the  cause  of female pattern hair loss is unclear; the cause of alopecia areata is autoimmune; and the cause of telogen effluvium is typically a physically or psychologically stressful event. [4] Telogen effluvium is very common following pregnancy. [4]\n\nLess  common  causes  of  hair  loss  without  inflammation  or scarring  include  the  pulling  out  of  hair,  certain  medications including chemotherapy, HIV/AIDS, hypothyroidism, and malnutrition  including  vitamin  B 12   and  iron  deficiencies. [3][4] Causes  of  hair  loss  that  occurs  with  scarring  or  inflammation include fungal infection, lupus erythematosus, radiation therapy,  and  sarcoidosis. [3][4]   Diagnosis  of  hair  loss  is  partly based on the areas affected. [4]\n\nTreatment of pattern hair loss may simply involve accepting the condition, which can also include shaving one's head. [4] Interventions that can be tried include the medications minoxidil  (or  finasteride) and  hair  transplant  surgery. [5][6] Alopecia  areata  may  be  treated  by  steroid  injections  in  the affected  area,  but  these  need  to  be  frequently  repeated  to  be effective. [4]   Hair  loss  is  a  common  experience. [4]   Pattern  hair loss  by  age  50  affects  about  half  of  men  and  a  quarter  of women. [4]  About 2% of people develop alopecia areata at some point in time. [4]\n\n\n## Terminology\n\nBaldness is the partial or complete lack of hair growth, and part of the wider topic of \"hair thinning\".

It  occurs,  most frequently, by the growth of vellus hair in areas of the body that normally produce terminal hair. Typically, the individual's hair growth is normal after birth, but shortly thereafter the hair is shed and replaced with sparse, abnormal hair growth. The new hair is typically fine, short and brittle, and may lack pigmentation. Baldness may be present by the time the subject is 25 years old. [8]"

        "text": "# Signs and symptoms\n\nSymptoms of hair loss include hair loss in patches usually in circular patterns, dandruff,  skin  lesions,  and  scarring.  Alopecia  areata  (mild  -  medium  level) usually shows in unusual hair loss areas, e.g., eyebrows, backside of the head or above the ears, areas the male pattern baldness usually does not affect. In male-pattern hair loss, loss and thinning begin at the temples and the crown and hair  either  thins  out  or  falls  out.  Female-pattern  hair  loss  occurs  at  the frontal and parietal.\n\nPeople have between 100,000 and 150,000 hairs on their head. The number of strands  normally  lost  in  a  day  varies  but  on  average  is  100. [9]   In  order  to maintain a normal volume, hair must be replaced at the same rate at which it is  lost.  The  first  signs  of  hair  thinning  that  people will often notice are more hairs  than  usual  left  in  the  hairbrush  after  brushing  or  in  the  basin  after shampooing. Styling can also reveal areas of thinning, such as a wider parting or a thinning crown.\n\n\n## Skin conditions\n\nA substantially  blemished  face,  back  and  limbs  could  point  to  cystic acne. The most severe form of the condition, cystic acne, arises from the same hormonal imbalances that cause hair loss and is associated with dihydrotestosterone production. [11]\n\n\n## Psychological\n\nThe psychology of hair thinning is a complex issue. Hair is considered an essential part of overall identity: especially for women, for whom it often represents femininity and attractiveness. Men typically associate a  full  head  of  hair  with  youth  and  vigor.  People  experiencing  hair thinning  often  find  themselves  in  a  situation  where  their  physical appearance is at odds with their own self-image and commonly worry that  they  appear  older  than  they  are  or  less  attractive  to  others. Psychological problems due to baldness, if present, are typically most severe at the onset of symptoms. [12]\n\nHair loss induced by cancer chemotherapy has been reported to cause changes in self-concept and body image. Body image does not return to the previous state after regrowth of hair for a majority of patients. In  such  cases,  patients  have  difficulties  expressing  their  feelings (alexithymia)  and  may  be  more  prone  to  avoiding  family  conflicts.\n\nFamily therapy can help families to cope with these psychological problems if they arise. [13]\n\n\n## Causes\n\nAlthough not completely understood, hair loss can have many causes:"

        "text": "# Pattern hair loss\n\nMale  pattern  hair  loss  is  believed  to  be  due  to  a  combination  of  genetics  and  the  male  hormone dihydrotestosterone. [4]  The cause in female pattern hair loss remains unclear. [4]\n\n\n## Infection\n\n\n- Dissecting cellulitis of the scalp\n- Fungal infections (such as tinea capitis)\n- Folliculitis from various causes\n- Demodex folliculitis, caused by Demodex folliculorum, a microscopic mite that feeds on the sebum produced by the sebaceous glands, denies hair essential nutrients and can cause thinning. Demodex folliculorum is not present on every scalp and is more likely to live in an excessively oily scalp environment.\n- Secondary syphilis [14]\n\n\n\n## Drugs\n\n\n- Temporary or permanent hair loss can be caused by several medications, including those for blood pressure problems, diabetes, heart disease and cholesterol. [15]  Any that affect the body's hormone balance can have a pronounced effect: these include the contraceptive pill, hormone replacement therapy, steroids and acne medications. [16]\n- Some treatments used to cure mycotic infections can cause massive hair loss. [17]\n- Medications (side effects from drugs, including chemotherapy, anabolic steroids, and birth control pills [ 18 ][ 15 ] )\n\n\n\n## Trauma\n\n\n- Traction alopecia is most commonly found in people with ponytails or cornrows who pull on their hair with excessive force. In addition, rigorous brushing and heat styling, rough scalp massage can damage the cuticle, the hard outer casing of the hair. This causes individual strands to become weak and break off, reducing overall hair volume.\n- Frictional alopecia is hair loss caused by rubbing of the hair or follicles, most infamously around the ankles of men from socks, where even if socks are no longer worn, the hair often will not grow back.\n- Trichotillomania is the loss of hair caused by compulsive pulling and bending of the hairs. Onset of this disorder tends to begin around the onset of puberty and usually continues through adulthood. Due to the constant extraction of the hair roots, permanent hair loss can occur.\n- Traumas such as childbirth, major surgery, poisoning, and severe stress may cause a hair loss condition known as telogen effluvium, [ 19 ] in which a large number of hairs enter the resting phase at the same time, causing shedding and subsequent thinning. The condition also presents as a side effect of chemotherapy - while targeting dividing cancer cells, this treatment also affects hair's growth phase with the result that almost 90% of hairs fall out soon after chemotherapy starts. [ 20 ]\n- Radiation to the scalp, as when radiotherapy is applied to the head for the treatment of certain cancers there, can cause baldness of the irradiated areas."

        "text": "# Pregnancy\n\nHair loss often follows childbirth in the postpartum period without causing baldness. During pregnancy, the hair  is  thicker  owing  to  increased  circulating  estrogens.  Approximately  three  months  after  giving  birth (typically between 2 and 5 months), estrogen levels drop and hair loss occurs, often particularly noticeably around the hairline and temple area. Hair typically grows back normally and treatment is not indicated. [21][22] A similar situation occurs in women taking the fertility-stimulating drug clomiphene.\n\n\n## Other causes\n\n\n- Autoimmune disease . Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder also known as \"spot baldness\" that can result in hair loss ranging from just one location (Alopecia areata monolocularis) to every hair on the entire body (Alopecia areata universalis). Although thought to be caused by hair follicles becoming dormant, what triggers alopecia areata is not known. In most cases the condition corrects itself, but it can also spread to the entire scalp (alopecia totalis) or to the entire body (alopecia universalis).\n- Skin diseases and cancer . Localized or diffuse hair loss may also occur in cicatricial alopecia (lupus erythematosus, lichen plano pilaris, folliculitis decalvans, central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia, postmenopausal frontal fibrosing alopecia, etc.). Tumours and skin outgrowths also induce localized baldness (sebaceous nevus, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma). Tumor alopecia is the hair loss in the immediate vicinity of either benign or malignant tumors of the scalp. [23]:  762\n- Hypothyroidism (an under-active thyroid) and the side effects of its related medications can cause hair loss, typically frontal, which is particularly associated with thinning of the outer third of the eyebrows (also seen with syphilis). Hyperthyroidism (an over-active thyroid) can also cause hair loss, which is parietal rather than frontal. [24]\n- Sebaceous cysts . Temporary loss of hair can occur in areas where sebaceous cysts are present for considerable duration (normally one to several weeks).\n- Congenital triangular alopecia - It is a triangular, or oval in some cases, shaped patch of hair loss in the temple area of the scalp that occurs mostly in young children. The affected area mainly contains vellus hair follicles or no hair follicles at all, but it does not expand. Its causes are unknown, and although it is a permanent condition, it does not have any other effect on the affected individuals. [25]\n- Hair growth conditions . Gradual thinning of hair with age is a natural condition known as involutional alopecia. This is caused by an increasing number of hair follicles switching from the growth, or anagen, phase into a resting phase, or telogen phase, so that remaining hairs become shorter and fewer in number. An unhealthy scalp environment can play a significant role in hair thinning by contributing to miniaturization or causing damage.\n- Obesity . Obesity-induced stress, such as that induced by a high-fat diet (HFD), targets hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) to accelerate hair thinning in mice. It is likely that similar molecular mechanism play a role in human hair loss. [26]\n\n\n\nOther causes of hair loss include:\n- Alopecia mucinosa\n- Biotinidase deficiency\n- Chronic inflammation\n- Diabetes [27]\n- Pseudopelade of Brocq\n- Telogen effluvium"

Each cycle consists of a long growing phase (anagen), a short transitional phase (catagen) and a short resting phase (telogen). At the end of the resting phase, the hair falls out (exogen) and a new hair starts growing in the follicle, beginning the cycle again.\n\nNormally, about 40 (0-78 in men) hairs reach the end of their resting phase each day and fall out. [28]  When more than 100 hairs  fall  out  per  day,  clinical  hair  loss  (telogen  effluvium)  may  occur.  A  disruption  of  the growing phase causes abnormal loss of anagen hairs (anagen effluvium).\n\n\n## Diagnosis\n\nBecause they are not usually associated with an increased loss rate, male-pattern and female-pattern hair loss do not generally require testing. If hair loss occurs in a young man with no family history, drug use could be the cause.\n\n\n- The pull test helps to evaluate diffuse scalp hair loss. Gentle traction is exerted on a group of hairs (about 40-60) on three different areas of the scalp. The number of extracted hairs is counted and examined under a microscope. Normally, fewer than three hairs per area should come out with each pull. If more than ten hairs are obtained, the pull test is considered positive. [29]\n- The pluck test is conducted by pulling hair out \"by the roots\". The root of the plucked hair is examined under a microscope to determine the phase of growth, and is used to diagnose a defect of telogen, anagen, or systemic disease. Telogen hairs have tiny bulbs without sheaths at their roots. Telogen effluvium shows an increased percentage of hairs upon examination. Anagen hairs have sheaths attached to their roots. Anagen effluvium shows a decrease in telogen-phase hairs and an increased number of broken hairs.\n- Scalp biopsy is used when the diagnosis is unsure; a biopsy allows for differing between scarring and nonscarring forms. Hair samples are taken from areas of inflammation, usually around the border of the bald patch.\n- Daily hair counts are normally done when the pull test is negative. It is done by counting the number of hairs lost. The hair from the first morning combing or during washing should be counted. The hair is collected in a clear plastic bag for 14 days. The strands are recorded. If the hair count is >100/day, it is considered abnormal except after shampooing, where hair counts will be up to 250 and be normal.\n- Trichoscopy is a noninvasive method of examining hair and scalp. The test may be performed with the use of a handheld dermoscope or a video dermoscope. It allows differential diagnosis of hair loss in most cases. [30]"

        "text": "There are two types of identification tests for female pattern baldness: the Ludwig Scale and the Savin Scale. Both  track  the  progress  of  diffused  thinning,  which  typically  begins  on  the  crown  of  the  head  behind  the hairline, and becomes gradually more pronounced. For male pattern baldness, the Hamilton-Norwood scale tracks the progress of a receding hairline and/or a thinning crown, through to a horseshoe-shaped ring of hair around the head and on to total baldness.\n\nIn almost all cases of thinning, and especially in cases of severe hair loss, it is recommended to seek advice from a doctor or dermatologist. Many types of thinning have an underlying genetic or health-related cause, which a qualified professional will be able to diagnose.\n\n\n# Management\n\n\n## Hiding hair loss\n\n\n## Head\n\nOne  method  of  hiding  hair  loss  is  the  comb  over,  which  involves restyling the remaining hair to cover the balding area. It is usually a temporary solution, useful only while the area of hair loss is small. As the hair loss increases, a comb over becomes less effective.\n\nAnother method is to wear a hat or a hairpiece such as a wig or toupee. The  wig  is  a  layer  of  artificial  or  natural  hair  made  to  resemble  a typical hair style. In most cases the hair is artificial. Wigs vary widely in  quality  and  cost.  In  the  United  States,  the  best  wigs  -  those  that look like real hair -cost up  to tens of thousands  of  dollars. Organizations also collect individuals' donations of their own natural\n\nhair to be made into wigs for young cancer patients who have lost their hair due to chemotherapy or other cancer treatment in addition to any type of hair loss.\n\n\n## Eyebrows\n\nThough not as common as the loss of hair on the head, chemotherapy, hormone imbalance, forms of hair loss, and other factors can also cause loss of hair in the eyebrows. Loss of growth in the outer one third of the eyebrow  is  often  associated  with  hypothyroidism.  Artificial  eyebrows  are  available  to  replace  missing eyebrows or to cover  patchy  eyebrows.  Eyebrow  embroidery  is  another  option  which  involves  the  use  of  a blade  to  add  pigment  to  the  eyebrows.  This  gives  a  natural  3D  look  for  those  who  are  worried  about  an artificial look and it lasts for two years. Micropigmentation (permanent makeup tattooing) is also available for those who want the look to be permanent.\n\n\n## Medications\n\nTreatments  for  the  various  forms  of  hair  loss  have  limited  success.  Three  medications  have  evidence  to support their use in male pattern hair loss: minoxidil, finasteride, and dutasteride. [31][32]  They typically work better to prevent further hair loss, than to regrow lost hair. [31]  On June 13, 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Olumiant (baricitinib) for adults with severe alopecia areatal. It is the first FDA approved drug for systemic treatment, or treatment for any area of the body. [33]\n\n\n- Minoxidil (Rogaine) is a nonprescription medication approved for male pattern baldness and alopecia areata. In a liquid or foam, it is rubbed into the scalp twice a day. Some people have an allergic reaction to the propylene glycol in the minoxidil solution and a minoxidil foam was developed without propylene glycol. Not all users will regrow hair. Minoxidil may also be taken orally although this route of administration is not approved by the FDA. [34]  The longer the hair has stopped growing,"

        "page": 7,
        "text": "- the less likely minoxidil will regrow hair. Minoxidil is not effective for other causes of hair loss. Hair regrowth can take 1 to 6 months to begin. Treatment must be continued indefinitely. If the treatment is stopped, hair loss resumes. Any regrown hair and any hair susceptible to being lost, while Minoxidil was used, will be lost. Most frequent side effects are mild scalp irritation, allergic contact dermatitis, and unwanted hair in other parts of the body. [32]\n- Finasteride (Propecia) is used in male-pattern hair loss in a pill form, taken 1 milligram per day. It is not indicated for women and is not recommended in pregnant women (as it is known to cause birth defects in fetuses). Treatment is effective starting within 6 weeks of treatment. Finasteride causes an increase in hair retention, the weight of hair, and some increase in regrowth. Side effects in about 2% of males include decreased sex drive, erectile dysfunction, and ejaculatory dysfunction. Treatment should be continued as long as positive results occur. Once treatment is stopped, hair loss resumes. [32]\n- Corticosteroids injections into the scalp can be used to treat alopecia areata. This type of treatment is repeated on a monthly basis. Oral pills for extensive hair loss may be used for alopecia areata. Results may take up to a month to be seen.\n- Immunosuppressants applied to the scalp have been shown to temporarily reverse alopecia areata, though the side effects of some of these drugs make such therapy questionable. [35]\n- There is some tentative evidence that anthralin may be useful for treating alopecia areata. [36]\n- Hormonal modulators (oral contraceptives or antiandrogens such as spironolactone and flutamide) can be used for female-pattern hair loss associated with hyperandrogenemia.\n\n\n\n## Surgery\n\nHair transplantation is usually carried out under local anesthetic. A surgeon will move healthy hair from the back and sides of the head to areas of thinning. The procedure can take between four and eight hours, and additional  sessions  can  be  carried  out  to  make  hair  even  thicker.  Transplanted  hair  falls  out  within  a  few weeks, but regrows permanently within months. [37]\n\n\n- Surgical options, such as follicle transplants, scalp flaps, and hair loss reduction, are available. These procedures are generally chosen by those who are self-conscious about their hair loss, but they are expensive and painful, with a risk of infection and scarring. Once surgery has occurred, six to eight months are needed before the quality of new hair can be assessed.\n- Scalp reduction is the process of decreasing of the area of bald skin on the head. In time, the skin on the head becomes flexible and stretched enough that some of it can be surgically removed. After the hairless scalp is removed, the space is closed with hair-covered scalp. Scalp reduction is generally done in combination with hair transplantation to provide a natural-looking hairline, especially those with extensive hair loss.\n- Hairline lowering can sometimes be used to lower a high hairline secondary to hair loss, although there may be a visible scar after further hair loss.\n- Wigs are an alternative to medical and surgical treatment; some patients wear a wig or hairpiece. They can be used permanently or temporarily to cover the hair loss. High-quality, natural-looking"

        "text": "# wigs and hairpieces are available.\n\n\n## Chemotherapy\n\nHypothermia caps may be used to prevent hair loss during some kinds of chemotherapy, specifically, when taxanes or anthracyclines are administered. [38]  It is not recommended to be used when cancer is present in the skin of the scalp or for lymphoma or leukemia. [39]  There are generally only minor side effects from scalp cooling given during chemotherapy. [40]\n\n\n## Embracing baldness\n\nInstead of attempting to conceal their hair loss, some people embrace it  by  either  doing  nothing  about  it  or  sporting  a  shaved  head. [41][42] The general public became more accepting of men with shaved heads in the early 1950s, when Russian-American actor Yul Brynner began sporting  the  look;  the  resulting  phenomenon  inspired  many  of  his male fans to shave their heads. [43]  Male celebrities then continued to bring  mainstream  popularity  to  shaved  heads, [44][45][46]   including athletes  such  as  Michael  Jordan [47]   and  Zinedine  Zidane  and  actors such as Dwayne Johnson, [48] Ben Kingsley, [49] and Jason Statham. [50]\n\nTo a lesser extent, female baldness can also be neutrally and positively intepreted  in  various  parts  of  the  world. [51][52]   For  example  head  shaving  is  not  uncommon  among  Black women, Buddhist nuns, lesbians and some radical feminists and can represent a release from superficial and restrictive appearance norms. [53][54]\n\n\n## Alternative medicine\n\nDietary supplements are not typically recommended. [32]  There is only one small trial of saw palmetto which shows tentative benefit  in  those  with  mild  to  moderate  androgenetic  alopecia. [32]   There  is  no  evidence  for biotin. [32]  Evidence for most other alternative medicine remedies is also insufficient. [55]  There was no good evidence for ginkgo, aloe vera, ginseng, bergamot, hibiscus, or sophora as of 2011. [55]\n\nMany people use unproven treatments to treat hair loss. [31]  Egg oil, in Indian, [56]  Japanese, Unani (Roghan Baiza Murgh) [57]  and Chinese [58]  traditional medicine, was traditionally used as a treatment for hair loss.\n\n\n## Research\n\nResearch  is  looking  into  connections  between  hair  loss  and  other  health  issues.  While  there  has  been speculation  about  a  connection  between  early-onset  male  pattern  hair  loss  and  heart  disease,  a  review  of articles from 1954 to 1999 found no conclusive connection between baldness and coronary artery disease. The dermatologists who conducted the review suggested further study was needed. [59]\n\nEnvironmental factors are under review. A 2007 study indicated that smoking may be a factor associated with age-related hair loss among Asian men. The study controlled for age and family history, and found statistically significant positive associations between moderate or severe male pattern hair loss and smoking status. [60]\n\nVertex  baldness  is  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  coronary  heart  disease  (CHD)  and  the  relationship depends upon the severity of baldness, while frontal baldness is not. Thus, vertex baldness might be a marker of CHD and is more closely associated with atherosclerosis than frontal baldness. [28]"

        "text": "# Hair follicle aging\n\nA  key  aspect  of  hair  loss  with  age  is  the  aging  of  the  hair  follicle. [61]   Ordinarily,  hair  follicle  renewal  is maintained by the stem cells associated with each follicle. Aging of the hair follicle appears to be primed by a sustained cellular response to the DNA damage that accumulates in renewing stem cells during aging. [62]  This damage response involves the proteolysis of type XVII collagen by neutrophil elastase in response to DNA damage  in  hair  follicle  stem  cells.  Proteolysis  of  collagen  leads  to  elimination  of  the  damaged  cells  and, consequently, to terminal hair follicle miniaturization.\n\n\n## Hedgehog signaling\n\nIn June 2022 the University of California, Irvine announced that researchers have discovered that hedgehog signaling  in  murine  fibroblasts  induces  new  hair  growth  and  hair  multiplication  while  hedgehog  activation increases  fibroblast  heterogeneity  and  drives  new  cell  states. [63]   A  new  signaling  molecule  called  SCUBE3 potently stimulates hair growth and may offer a therapeutic treatment for androgenetic alopecia. [64]\n\n\n## Etymology\n\nThe term alopecia (/ ˌ æl əˈ pi ːʃ i ə /) is from the Classical Greek ἀ λώπηξ, alōpēx , meaning \"fox\". The origin of this usage is because this animal sheds its coat twice a year, or because in ancient Greece foxes often lost hair because of mange.\n\n\n## See also\n\n\n- Alopecia in animals\n- Lichen planopilaris\n- List of conditions caused by problems with junctional proteins\n- Locks of Love - charity that provides hair prosthetics to alopecia patients\n- Psychogenic alopecia"
