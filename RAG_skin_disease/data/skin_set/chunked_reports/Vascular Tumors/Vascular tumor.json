        "text": "# Vascular tumor\n\nA vascular tumor is a vascular anomaly where a tumor forms from cells that make blood or lymph vessels; a soft tissue growth that can be either benign or malignant. [1]  Examples of vascular tumors include hemangiomas, hemangioendotheliomas, Kaposi's sarcomas, angiosarcomas, and hemangioblastomas. An angioma refers to any type of benign vascular tumor. [2]\n\nSome  vascular  tumors  can  be  associated  with  serious  bloodclotting disorders, making correct diagnosis critical. [3]\n\nA  vascular  tumor  may  be  described  in  terms  of  being highly vascularized , or poorly vascularized , referring to the degree of blood supply to the tumor.\n\n\n## Classification\n\nVascular  tumors  make  up  one  of  the  classifications  of  vascular  anomalies.  The  other  grouping  is  vascular malformations. Vascular tumors can be further subclassified as being benign, borderline or aggressive, and malignant. Vascular tumors are described as proliferative , and vascular malformations as nonproliferative .

[5]   They  are  characterised  by  the  abnormal proliferation  of  endothelial  cells  and  of  deviant  blood  vessel  formation  or  architecture.

Their growth is slow to begin with, and progresses to a stable size. They show a high rate of spontaneous regression, particularly in congenital and early-onset cases.
