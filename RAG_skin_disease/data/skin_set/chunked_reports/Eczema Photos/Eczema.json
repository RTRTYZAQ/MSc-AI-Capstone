[1]  In cases of short duration, there may be small blisters, while in long-term cases the skin may become thickened. [1]  The area of skin involved can vary from small to covering the entire body. [1][2]  Dermatitis is also called eczema but the same term is  often  used for the most common type of skin inflammation, atopic dermatitis. [7]\n\nThe exact cause of the condition is often unclear. [2]  Cases may involve a combination of allergy and poor venous return. [1]  The type  of  dermatitis  is  generally  determined  by  the  person's history  and  the  location  of  the  rash. [1]   For  example,  irritant dermatitis often occurs on the hands of those who frequently get them wet. [1]  Allergic contact dermatitis occurs upon exposure to an allergen, causing a hypersensitivity reaction in the skin. [1]",

Although every type of dermatitis has different symptoms, there are certain signs that are common for all of them, including redness of the skin,  swelling,  itching  and  skin  lesions  with  sometimes oozing and scarring. Also, the area of the skin on which the symptoms appear tends to be different with every type of dermatitis,  whether  on  the  neck,  wrist,  forearm,  thigh  or ankle.\n\nAlthough the location may vary, the primary symptom of this condition is itchy skin. More rarely, it may appear on the  genital  area,  such  as  the  vulva  or  scrotum. [17][18]\n\nSymptoms of this type of dermatitis may be very intense and may come and go.

[19]  Typical affected skin areas include the folds of the arms, the back of the knees, wrists, face and hands. Perioral dermatitis refers to a red bumpy rash around the mouth. [20]\n\nDermatitis herpetiformis symptoms include itching, stinging and a burning sensation. Papules and vesicles are commonly present. [21]  The small red bumps experienced in this type of dermatitis are usually about 1 cm in  size,  red  in  color  and  may  be  found  symmetrically  grouped  or  distributed  on  the  upper  or  lower  back, buttocks, elbows, knees, neck, shoulders and scalp.",

        "text": "# Dermatitis\n\nDermatitis is a term used for different types of skin inflammation, typically characterized by itchiness, redness and a rash. [1]  In cases of short duration, there may be small blisters, while in long-term cases the skin may become thickened. [1]  The area of skin involved can vary from small to covering the entire body. [1][2]  Dermatitis is also called eczema but the same term is  often  used for the most common type of skin inflammation, atopic dermatitis. [7]\n\nThe exact cause of the condition is often unclear. [2]  Cases may involve a combination of allergy and poor venous return. [1]  The type  of  dermatitis  is  generally  determined  by  the  person's history  and  the  location  of  the  rash. [1]   For  example,  irritant dermatitis often occurs on the hands of those who frequently get them wet. [1]  Allergic contact dermatitis occurs upon exposure to an allergen, causing a hypersensitivity reaction in the skin. [1]\n\nPrevention of  atopic  dermatitis  is  typically  with  essential  fatty acids, [4]   and  may  be  treated  with  moisturizers  and  steroid creams. [5]   The  steroid  creams  should  generally  be  of  mid-to high strength and used for less than two weeks at a time, as side effects  can  occur. [8]   Antibiotics  may  be  required  if  there  are signs of skin infection. [2]  Contact dermatitis is typically treated by  avoiding  the  allergen  or  irritant. [9][10]   Antihistamines  may help with sleep and decrease nighttime scratching. [2]\n\nDermatitis was estimated to affect 245 million people globally in 2015, [6]  or 3.34% of the world population. Atopic dermatitis is the most common type and generally starts in childhood. [1][2]  In the United States, it affects about 10-30% of people. [2]  Contact dermatitis  is  twice  as  common  in  females  as  in  males. [11] Allergic  contact  dermatitis  affects  about  7%  of  people  at  some point  in  their  lives. [12]   Irritant  contact  dermatitis  is  common, especially  among  people  with  certain  occupations;  exact  rates are unclear. [13]\n\n\n## Terminology\n\nThe terms dermatitis and eczema are sometimes used synonymously. [1][14]  However the term eczema is often used to specifically mean atopic dermatitis (also known as atopic eczema). [15][7]  Terminology might also differ according  to  countries.  In  some  languages,  dermatitis  and  eczema  mean  the  same  thing,  while  in  other languages dermatitis implies an acute condition and eczema a chronic one.

        "text": "# Signs and symptoms\n\nThere  are  several  types  of  dermatitis  including  atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, stasis dermatitis and seborrhoeic dermatitis. [2]  Dermatitis symptoms vary with all different forms of the condition. Although every type of dermatitis has different symptoms, there are certain signs that are common for all of them, including redness of the skin,  swelling,  itching  and  skin  lesions  with  sometimes oozing and scarring. Also, the area of the skin on which the symptoms appear tends to be different with every type of dermatitis,  whether  on  the  neck,  wrist,  forearm,  thigh  or ankle.\n\nAlthough the location may vary, the primary symptom of this condition is itchy skin. More rarely, it may appear on the  genital  area,  such  as  the  vulva  or  scrotum. [17][18]\n\nSymptoms of this type of dermatitis may be very intense and may come and go. Irritant contact dermatitis is usually more painful than itchy.\n\nAlthough the symptoms of atopic dermatitis vary from person to person, the most common symptoms are dry, itchy, red skin, on light skin. However, this redness does not appear on darker skin and dermatitis can appear darker brown or purple in color. [19]  Typical affected skin areas include the folds of the arms, the back of the knees, wrists, face and hands. Perioral dermatitis refers to a red bumpy rash around the mouth. [20]\n\nDermatitis herpetiformis symptoms include itching, stinging and a burning sensation. Papules and vesicles are commonly present. [21]  The small red bumps experienced in this type of dermatitis are usually about 1 cm in  size,  red  in  color  and  may  be  found  symmetrically  grouped  or  distributed  on  the  upper  or  lower  back, buttocks, elbows, knees, neck, shoulders and scalp.\n\nThe symptoms of seborrhoeic dermatitis, on the other hand, tend to appear gradually, from dry or greasy scaling of the scalp (dandruff) to scaling of facial areas, sometimes with itching, but without hair loss. [22]  In newborns,  the  condition  causes  a  thick  and  yellowish  scalp  rash,  often  accompanied  by  a  diaper  rash.  In severe cases, symptoms may appear along the hairline, behind the ears, on the eyebrows, on the bridge of the nose, around the nose, on the chest, and on the upper back. [23]\n\n\n## Complications\n\nPeople with eczema should not receive the smallpox vaccination due to risk of developing eczema vaccinatum, a potentially severe and sometimes fatal complication. [24]  Other major health risks for people with dermatitis are  viral  and  bacterial  infections  because  atopic  dermatitis  patients  have  deficiencies  in  their  proteins  and\n\nMore severe dermatitis"

[25]  If left untreated, these infections may be life-threatening, so skin  barrier  improvement  (such  as  daily  moisturizing  to  minimize  transepidermal  water  loss)  and  antiinflammatory therapy are recommended as preventative measures. [25]\n\n\n# Cause\n\nThe  cause  of  dermatitis  is  unknown  but  is  presumed  to  be  a  combination  of  genetic  and  environmental factors. [2]  Eczema is not contagious.\n\n\n## Environmental\n\nThe  hygiene  hypothesis  postulates  that  the  cause  of  asthma,  eczema,  and  other  allergic  diseases  is  an unusually clean environment in childhood which leads to an insufficient human microbiota. It is supported by epidemiologic  studies  for  asthma. [26]   The  hypothesis  states  that  exposure  to  bacteria  and  other  immune system modulators is important during development, and missing out on this exposure increases the risk for asthma  and  allergy. [27]   One  systematic  review  of  literature  on  eczema  found  that  urban  areas  have  an increased prevalence of eczema compared to rural areas. [28]  While it has been suggested that eczema may sometimes  be  an  allergic  reaction  to  the  excrement  from  house  dust  mites, [29]   with  up  to  5%  of  people showing antibodies to the mites, [30]  the overall role this plays awaits further corroboration. [31]\n\n\n## Malnutrition\n\nEssential fatty acid deficiency results in a dermatitis similar to that seen in zinc or biotin deficiency. [4]\n\n\n## Genetic\n\nA number of genes have been associated with eczema, one of which affects production of filaggrin. [5]  Genomewide studies found three new genetic variants associated with eczema: OVOL1, ACTL9 and IL4-KIF3A. [32]\n\nEczema occurs about three times more frequently in individuals with celiac disease and about two times more frequently  in  relatives  of  those  with  celiac  disease,  potentially  indicating  a  genetic  link  between  the conditions. [33][34]\n\n\n## Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosis  of  eczema  is  based  mostly  on  the  history  and  physical  examination. [5]   In  uncertain  cases,  skin biopsy may be taken for a histopathologic diagnosis of dermatitis. [35]  Those with eczema may be especially prone to misdiagnosis of food allergies. [36]\n\nPatch tests are used in the diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis. [37][38]\n\n\n## Classification\n\nThe term eczema refers to a set of clinical characteristics. Classification of the underlying diseases has been haphazard with numerous different classification systems, and many synonyms being used to describe the same condition. [39]\n\nA  type  of  dermatitis  may  be  described  by  location  (e.g.,  hand  eczema),  by  specific  appearance  (eczema craquele or discoid) or by possible cause (varicose eczema). Further adding to the confusion, many sources use the term eczema interchangeably for the most common type: atopic dermatitis. [27]"

[40]  Non-allergic eczemas are not affected by this proposal.\n\n\n# Histopathologic classification\n\nBy histopathology, superficial dermatitis (in the epidermis, papillary dermis, and superficial vascular plexus) can basically be classified into either of the following groups: [41]\n\n\n- Vesiculobullous lesions\n- Pustular dermatosis\n- Non vesiculobullous, non-pustular\n- With epidermal changes\n- Without epidermal changes. These characteristically have a superficial perivascular infl ammatory infiltrate and can be classified by type of cell infiltrate: [ 41 ]\n- Lymphocytic (most common)\n- Lymphoeosinophilic\n- Lymphoplasmacytic\n- Mast cell\n- Lymphohistiocytic\n- Neutrophilic\n\n\n\n## Common types\n\n\n## Atopic\n\nAtopic dermatitis is an allergic disease believed to have a hereditary component and often runs in families whose  members  have  asthma.  Itchy  rash  is  particularly  noticeable  on  the  head  and  scalp,  neck,  inside  of elbows,  behind  knees,  and  buttocks.  It  is  very  common  in  developed  countries  and  rising.  Irritant  contact dermatitis is sometimes misdiagnosed as atopic dermatitis. Stress can cause atopic dermatitis to worsen. [42]\n\n\n## Contact\n\nContact dermatitis is of two types: allergic (resulting from a delayed reaction to an allergen, such as poison ivy, nickel, or Balsam of Peru), [43]  and irritant (resulting from direct reaction to a detergent, such as sodium lauryl sulfate, for example).\n\nSome  substances  act  both  as  allergen  and  irritants  (wet  cement,  for  example).  Other  substances  cause  a problem after sunlight exposure, bringing on phototoxic dermatitis. About three-quarters of cases of contact eczema  are  of  the  irritant  type,  which  is  the  most  common  occupational  skin  disease.  Contact  eczema  is curable,  provided  the  offending  substance  can  be  avoided  and  its  traces  removed  from  one's  environment. (ICD-10 L23; L24; L56.1; L56.0)\n\n\n## Seborrhoeic\n\nSeborrhoeic dermatitis or seborrheic dermatitis is a condition sometimes classified as a form of eczema that is closely related to dandruff. It causes dry or greasy peeling of the scalp, eyebrows, and face, and sometimes trunk. In newborns, it causes a thick, yellow, crusty scalp rash called cradle cap, which seems related to lack of biotin and is often curable. (ICD-10 L21; L21.0)"

[44]\n\n\n# Less common types\n\n\n## Dyshidrosis\n\nDyshidrosis (dyshidrotic eczema, pompholyx, vesicular palmoplantar dermatitis) only occurs on palms, soles, and sides of fingers and toes. Tiny opaque bumps called vesicles, thickening, and cracks are accompanied by itching,  which  gets  worse  at  night.  A  common  type  of  hand  eczema,  it  worsens  in  warm  weather.  (ICD-10 L30.1)\n\n\n## Discoid\n\nDiscoid eczema (nummular eczema, exudative eczema, microbial eczema) is characterized by round spots of oozing  or  dry  rash,  with  clear  boundaries,  often  on  lower  legs.  It  is  usually  worse  in  winter.  The  cause  is unknown, and the condition tends to come and go. (ICD-10 L30.0)\n\n\n## Venous\n\nVenous  eczema  (gravitational  eczema,  stasis  dermatitis,  varicose  eczema)  occurs  in  people  with  impaired circulation, varicose veins, and edema, and is particularly common in the ankle area of people over 50. There is redness, scaling, darkening of the skin, and itching. The disorder predisposes to leg ulcers. (ICD-10 I83.1)\n\n\n## Herpetiformis\n\nDermatitis  herpetiformis  (Duhring's  disease)  causes  an  intensely  itchy  and  typically  symmetrical  rash  on arms, thighs, knees, and back. It is directly related to celiac disease, can often be put into remission with an appropriate diet, and tends to get worse at night. (ICD-10 L13.0)\n\n\n## Hyperkeratotic\n\nHyperkeratotic hand dermatitis presents with hyperkeratotic, fissure-prone, erythematous areas of the middle or proximal palm, and the volar surfaces of the fingers may also be involved.

It is completely curable with the clearance of the original infection that caused it. The  appearance  varies  depending  on  the  cause.  It  always  occurs  some  distance  away  from  the  original infection. (ICD-10 L30.2)\n\n\n## Viral\n\nThere  are  eczemas  overlaid  by  viral  infections  (eczema  herpeticum  or  vaccinatum),  and  eczemas  resulting from underlying disease (e.g., lymphoma).\n\nEczemas  originating  from  ingestion  of  medications,  foods,  and  chemicals,  have  not  yet  been  clearly systematized.

        "text": "# Prevention\n\nThere have been various studies on the prevention of dermatitis through diet, none of which have proven any positive effect.\n\nExclusive breastfeeding of infants during at least the first few months may decrease the risk. [46]  There is no good evidence that a mother's diet during pregnancy or breastfeeding affects the risk, [46]  nor is there evidence that delayed introduction of certain foods is useful. [46]  There is tentative evidence that probiotics in infancy may reduce rates but it is insufficient to recommend its use. [47]  There is moderate certainty evidence that the use of skin care interventions such as emollients within the first year of life of an infant's life is not effective in preventing  eczema. [48]   In  fact,  it  may  increase  the  risk  of  skin  infection  and  of  unwanted  effects  such  as allergic reaction to certain moisturizers and a stinging sensation. [48]\n\n\n## Healthy diet\n\nThere has not been adequate evaluation of changing the diet to reduce eczema. [49][50]  There is some evidence that infants with an established egg allergy may have a reduction in symptoms if eggs are eliminated from their  diets. [49]   Benefits  have  not  been  shown  for  other  elimination  diets,  though  the  studies  are  small  and poorly executed. [49][50]  Establishing that there is a food allergy before dietary change could avoid unnecessary lifestyle changes. [49]\n\n\n## Fatty acids\n\nOils with fatty acids that have been studied to prevent dermatitis include: [51][52]\n\n\n- Corn oil: Linoleic acid (LA)\n- Fish oil: Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)\n- Hemp seed oil: Linoleic acid (LA), and alpha-Linolenic acid (ALA)\n\n\nIn  the  1950s  Arild  Hansen  showed  that  infants  fed  skimmed  milk  developed  essential  fatty  acid  deficiency which was characterized by an increased food intake, poor growth, and a scaly dermatitis, and was cured by the administration of corn oil.\n\n\n## Management\n\nThere is no known cure for some types of dermatitis, with treatment aiming to control symptoms by reducing inflammation and relieving itching. Contact dermatitis is treated by avoiding what is causing it.\n\nSeborrheic dermatitis is treated with antifungals such as anti-dandruff shampoo. [44]\n\n\n## Lifestyle\n\nBathing  once  or  more  a  day  is  recommended,  usually  for  five  to  ten  minutes  in  warm  water. [5][53]   Soaps should be avoided, as they tend to strip the skin of natural oils and lead to excessive dryness. [54]  The American Academy of Dermatology suggests using a controlled amount of bleach diluted in a bath to help with atopic dermatitis. [55]\n\nPeople can wear clothing designed to manage the itching, scratching and peeling. [56]\n\nHouse  dust  mite  reduction  and  avoidance  measures  have  been  studied  in  low  quality  trials  and  have  not shown evidence of improving eczema. [57]"

        "text": "# Moisturizers\n\nLow-quality evidence indicates that moisturizing agents (emollients) may reduce eczema severity and lead to fewer flares. [58]  In children, oil-based formulations appear to be better, and water-based formulations are not  recommended. [5]   It  is  unclear  if  moisturizers  that  contain  ceramides  are  more  or  less  effective  than others. [59]   Products  that  contain  dyes,  perfumes,  or  peanuts  should  not  be  used. [5]   Occlusive  dressings  at night may be useful. [5]\n\nSome moisturizers or barrier creams may reduce irritation in occupational irritant hand dermatitis, [60]  a skin disease that can affect people in jobs that regularly come into contact with water, detergents, chemicals or other irritants. [60]  Some emollients may reduce the number of flares in people with dermatitis. [58]\n\n\n## Medications\n\n\n## Corticosteroids\n\nIf  symptoms  are  well  controlled  with  moisturizers,  steroids  may  only  be  required  when  flares  occur. [5] Corticosteroids  are  effective  in  controlling  and  suppressing  symptoms  in  most  cases. [61]   Once  daily  use  is generally enough. [5]  For mild-moderate eczema a weak steroid may be used (e.g., hydrocortisone), while in more severe cases a higher-potency steroid (e.g., clobetasol propionate) may be used. In severe cases, oral or injectable corticosteroids may be used. While these usually bring about rapid improvements, they have greater side effects.\n\nLong term use of topical steroids may result in skin atrophy, stria, and telangiectasia. [5]  Their use on delicate skin (face or groin) is therefore typically with caution. [5]  They are, however, generally well tolerated. [62]  Red burning skin, where the skin turns red upon stopping steroid use, has been reported among adults who use topical steroids at least daily for more than a year. [63]\n\n\n## Antihistamines\n\nThere  is  little  evidence  supporting  the  use  of  antihistamine  medications  for  the  relief  of  dermatitis. [5][64] Sedative antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine, may be useful in those who are unable to sleep due to eczema. [5]  Second generation antihistamines have minimal evidence of benefit. [65]  Of the second generation antihistamines studied, fexofenadine is the only one to show evidence of improvement in itching with minimal side effects. [65]\n\n\n## Immunosuppressants\n\nTopical  immunosuppressants like pimecrolimus and tacrolimus may be better in the short term and appear equal to steroids after a year of use. [66]  Their use is reasonable in those who do not respond to or are not tolerant of steroids. [67][68]  Treatments are typically recommended for  short  or  fixed  periods  of  time  rather  than  indefinitely. [5][69] Tacrolimus 0.1% has generally proved more effective than pimecrolimus, and equal in effect to mid-potency topical steroids. [70] There is no association to increased risk of cancer from topical use of pimecrolimus nor tacrolimus. [69][71]\n\nWhen  eczema  is  severe  and  does  not  respond  to  other  forms  of treatment,  systemic  immunosuppressants  are  sometimes  used.  Immunosuppressants  can  cause  significant side effects and some require regular blood tests. The most commonly used are cyclosporin, azathioprine, and methotrexate.\n\nDupilumab is a new [note 1]  medication that improves eczema lesions, especially moderate to severe eczema. [74] Dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody, suppresses inflammation by targeting the interleukin-4 receptor."

        "text": "# Antifungals\n\nAntifungals are used in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. [44]\n\n\n## Others\n\nIn September 2021, ruxolitinib cream (Opzelura) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  for  the  topical  treatment  of  mild  to  moderate  atopic  dermatitis. [75]   It  is  a  topical  Janus  kinase inhibitor. [75]\n\n\n## Light therapy\n\n\n## Narrowband UVB\n\nAtopic dermatitis (AD) may be treated with narrowband UVB, [76]  which increases 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3  in persons in individuals with AD. [77]\n\nLight therapy using heliotherapy, balneophototherapy, psoralen plus UVA (PUVA therapy), light has tentative support but the quality of the evidence is not very good compared with narrowband UVB and UVA1. [78]  UVB is more effective than UVA1 for treatment of atopical dermatitis. [79]\n\nOverexposure to ultraviolet light carries its own risks, particularly that of skin cancer. [80]\n\n\n## Alternative medicine\n\n\n## Topical\n\nChiropractic spinal manipulation lacks evidence to support its use for dermatitis. [81]  There is little evidence supporting  the  use  of  psychological  treatments. [82]   While  dilute  bleach  baths  have  been  used  for  infected dermatitis there is little evidence for this practice. [83]\n\n\n## Supplements\n\n\n- Sulfur: There is currently no scientific evidence for the claim that sulfur treatment relieves eczema. [ 84 ]\n- Chinese herbology: it is unclear whether Chinese herbs help or harm. [ 85 ] Dietary supplements are commonly used by people with eczema. [86]\n- Neither evening primrose oil nor borage seed oil taken orally have been shown to be effective. [ 87 ] Both are associated with gastrointestinal upset. [ 87 ]\n- Probiotics are likely to make little to no difference in symptoms. [ 88 ]\n\n\n\n## Prognosis\n\nMost cases are well managed with topical treatments and ultraviolet light. [5]  About 2% of cases are not. [5]  In more than 60% of young children, the condition subsides by adolescence. [5]\n\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nGlobally  dermatitis  affected  approximately  230  million  people  as  of  2010  (3.5%  of  the  population). [89] Dermatitis is most commonly seen in infancy, with female predominance of eczema presentations occurring during the reproductive period of 15-49 years. [90]  In the UK about 20% of children have the condition, while in the United States about 10% are affected. [5]"

        "text": "Although little data on the rates of eczema over time exists prior to the 1940s, the rate of eczema has been found  to  have  increased  substantially  in  the  latter  half  of  the  20th  century,  with  eczema  in  school-aged children being found to increase between the late 1940s and 2000. [91]  In the developed world there has been rise in the rate of eczema over time. The incidence and lifetime prevalence of eczema in England has been seen to increase in recent times. [5][92]\n\nDermatitis affected about 10% of U.S. workers in 2010, representing over 15 million workers with dermatitis. Prevalence rates were higher among females than among males and among those with some college education or a college degree compared to those with a high school diploma or less. Workers employed in healthcare and social assistance industries and life, physical, and social science occupations had the highest rates of reported dermatitis.  About  6%  of  dermatitis  cases  among  U.S.  workers  were  attributed  to  work  by  a  healthcare professional,  indicating  that  the  prevalence  rate  of  work-related  dermatitis  among  workers  was  at  least 0.6%. [93]\n\n\n# Etymology and history\n\nThe  term atopic  dermatitis was  coined  in  1933  by  Wise  and Sulzberger. [95]   Sulfur  as  a  topical  treatment  for  eczema  was fashionable in the Victorian and Edwardian eras. [84]\n\nThe  word dermatitis is  from  the  Greek δέρμα derma 'skin'  and -ῖ τις -itis 'inflammation'  and eczema is  from  Greek: ἔ κζεμα ekzema 'eruption'. [96]\n\n\n## Society and culture\n\nSome cosmetics  are  marketed  as  hypoallergenic  to  imply  that  their  use  is  less  likely  to  lead  to  an  allergic reaction than other products. [97]  However, the term hypoallergenic is not regulated, [98]  and no research has been done showing that products labeled hypoallergenic are less problematic than any others. In 1977, courts overruled the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's regulation of the use of the term hypoallergenic. [97]  In 2019,  the  European  Union  released  a  document  about  claims  made  concerning  cosmetics, [99]   but  this  was issued as guidance, not a regulation. [100]\n\n\n## Research\n\nMonoclonal antibodies are under preliminary research to determine their potential as treatments for atopic dermatitis, with only dupilumab showing evidence of efficacy, as of 2018. [101][102]\n\n\n## Notes\n\n\n- Dupilumab received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in 2017 [72] and for asthma in 2018. [ 73 ]"
