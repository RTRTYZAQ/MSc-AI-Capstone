[1]\n\nConnective  tissues  protect,  support,  and  provide  structure  for the body's other tissues and structures. [2]  They hold the body's structures  together.  Connective  tissues  consist  of  two  distinct proteins: elastin and collagen. Tendons, ligaments, skin, cartilage, bone, and blood vessels are all made of collagen. Skin and  ligaments  also  contain  elastin.  These  proteins  and  the surrounding  tissues  may  suffer  damage  when  the  connective tissues become inflamed. [3]\n\nThe two main categories of connective tissue diseases are (1) a set of relatively rare genetic disorders affecting the primary structure of connective tissue, and (2) a variety of acquired diseases where the connective tissues are the site of multiple, more or less distinct immunological and inflammatory reactions.\n\nDiseases  in  which  inflammation  or  weakness  of  collagen  tends  to  occur  are  also  referred  to  as  collagen diseases. Collagen vascular diseases can be (but are not necessarily) associated with collagen and blood vessel abnormalities that are autoimmune in nature.",

Others  may  be  due  to environmental factors, or a combination of genetic and environmental influences.\n\n\n## Classification\n\n\nConnective  tissue  disease  is  an  umbrella  term  for  many  different  types  of  diseases. [4]   Connective  tissue diseases can be classified into two groups:\n- a group of relatively rare genetic disorders affecting the primary structure of connective tissue;\n- a number of acquired conditions where the connective tissues are the site of multiple, more or less distinct immune and inflammatory reactions. [1]\n\n\n\n## Heritable connective tissue disorders\n\nHereditary connective tissue disorders are a diverse set of broad, single-gene disorders that impact one or more of the main components of connective tissues, such as ground substance (glycosaminoglycans), collagen, or elastin. Many result in anomalies of the skeleton and joints, which can substantially impair normal growth and development. In contrast to acquired connective tissue diseases, these conditions are uncommon.
