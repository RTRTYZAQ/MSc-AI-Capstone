[1]   Symptoms  vary  among  people  and  may  be  mild  to severe. [1]   Common  symptoms  include  painful  and  swollen joints, fever, chest pain, hair loss, mouth ulcers, swollen lymph nodes, feeling tired, and a red rash which is most commonly on the face. [1]   Often  there are periods of illness, called flares, and periods  of  remission  during  which  there  are  few  symptoms. [1] Children up to 18 years old develop a more severe form of SLE termed childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus. [4]\n\nLupus is Latin for 'wolf': the disease was so-named in the 13th century as the rash was thought to appear like a wolf's bite. [5]",

[6]   Among identical twins, if one is affected there is a 24% chance the other one  will  also  develop  the  disease. [1]   Female  sex  hormones, sunlight, smoking, vitamin D deficiency, and certain infections are also believed to increase a person's risk. [6]  The mechanism involves  an  immune  response  by  autoantibodies  against  a person's own tissues. [1]  These are most commonly anti-nuclear antibodies and they result in inflammation. [1]  Diagnosis can be difficult  and  is  based  on  a  combination  of  symptoms  and laboratory tests.

[12]  SLE is a classical item in differential diagnosis, [13]  because SLE symptoms vary widely and come and go unpredictably. Diagnosis can thus be elusive, with some people having unexplained symptoms of SLE for years before a definitive diagnosis is reached. [14]\n\nCommon initial and chronic complaints include fever, malaise, joint pains, muscle pains, and fatigue. Because these symptoms are so often seen in association with other diseases, these signs and symptoms are not  part  of  the  diagnostic  criteria  for  SLE.  When  occurring  in conjunction  with  other  signs  and  symptoms,  however,  they  are considered suggestive. [15]\n\nWhile SLE can occur in both males and females, it is found far more often  in  women,  and  the  symptoms  associated  with  each  sex  are different.

[119][131]\n\n\n# Analgesia\n\nSince  a  large  percentage  of  people  with  SLE  have  varying  amounts  of  chronic  pain,  stronger  prescription analgesics (painkillers) may be used if over-the-counter drugs (mainly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) do not provide effective relief. Potent NSAIDs  such  as  indomethacin  and  diclofenac  are  relatively contraindicated for people with SLE because they increase the risk of kidney failure and heart failure. [119]\n\nPain is typically treated with opioids, varying in potency based on the severity of symptoms. When opioids are used for prolonged periods, drug tolerance, chemical dependency, and addiction may occur. Opiate addiction is  not  typically  a  concern  since  the  condition  is  not  likely  to  ever  completely  disappear.  Thus,  lifelong treatment with opioids is fairly common for chronic pain symptoms, accompanied by periodic titration that is typical of any long-term opioid regimen. [132]",

It is believed that  they  reduce  antibody production or promote the clearance of immune complexes from the body, even though their mechanism of action is not well understood. [133] Unlike immunosuppressives and corticosteroids, IVIGs do not suppress the immune system, so there is less risk of serious infections with these drugs. [134]\n\n\n## Lifestyle changes\n\nAvoiding sunlight in SLE is critical since ultraviolet radiation is known to exacerbate skin manifestations of the disease. [135]  Avoiding activities that induce fatigue is also important since those with SLE fatigue easily and it can be debilitating. These two problems can lead to people becoming housebound for long periods of time. Physical exercise has been shown to help improve fatigue in adult with SLE. [135]  Drugs unrelated to SLE should  be  prescribed  only  when  known  not  to  exacerbate  the  disease.  Occupational  exposure  to  silica, pesticides,  and  mercury  can  also  worsen  the  disease.

In  this  form  of  the  disease,  the  cause  is  very  different  from  lupus: thromboses (blood clots or \"sticky blood\") form in blood vessels, which prove to be fatal if they move within the bloodstream.

[139]   Neonatal lupus is rare, but identification of mothers at the highest risk for complications allows for prompt treatment before or after birth. In addition, SLE can flare up during pregnancy, and proper treatment can maintain the health of the mother longer.

The mortality risk is fivefold when compared to the normal population in the late stages, which can be attributed to cardiovascular disease from accelerated atherosclerosis, the leading cause of death for people with SLE. [119]  To reduce the potential for cardiovascular issues, high blood pressure and high cholesterol should be prevented or treated aggressively.

All  explanations  originate  with  the  reddish,  butterflyshaped malar rash that the disease classically exhibits across the nose and  cheeks.  The  reason  the  term  lupus  was  used  to  describe  this disease comes from the mid-19th century. Many diseases that caused ulceration or necrosis were given the term \"lupus\" due to the wound being  reminiscent  of  a  wolf's  bite.

        "text": "# Lupus\n\nLupus , formally called systemic  lupus  erythematosus ( SLE ),  is  an  autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system  mistakenly  attacks  healthy  tissue  in  many  parts  of  the body. [1]   Symptoms  vary  among  people  and  may  be  mild  to severe. [1]   Common  symptoms  include  painful  and  swollen joints, fever, chest pain, hair loss, mouth ulcers, swollen lymph nodes, feeling tired, and a red rash which is most commonly on the face. [1]   Often  there are periods of illness, called flares, and periods  of  remission  during  which  there  are  few  symptoms. [1] Children up to 18 years old develop a more severe form of SLE termed childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus. [4]\n\nLupus is Latin for 'wolf': the disease was so-named in the 13th century as the rash was thought to appear like a wolf's bite. [5]\n\nThe  cause  of  SLE  is  not  clear. [1]   It  is  thought  to  involve  a combination  of  genetics  and  environmental  factors. [6]   Among identical twins, if one is affected there is a 24% chance the other one  will  also  develop  the  disease. [1]   Female  sex  hormones, sunlight, smoking, vitamin D deficiency, and certain infections are also believed to increase a person's risk. [6]  The mechanism involves  an  immune  response  by  autoantibodies  against  a person's own tissues. [1]  These are most commonly anti-nuclear antibodies and they result in inflammation. [1]  Diagnosis can be difficult  and  is  based  on  a  combination  of  symptoms  and laboratory tests. [1]  There are a number of other kinds of lupus erythematosus including discoid lupus erythematosus, neonatal lupus, and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. [1]\n\nThere  is  no  cure  for  SLE, [1]   but  there  are  experimental  and symptomatic  treatments. [7]   Treatments  may  include  NSAIDs, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, hydroxychloroquine, and methotrexate. [1]   Although  corticosteroids  are  rapidly  effective, long-term use results in side effects. [8]  Alternative medicine has not  been  shown  to  affect  the  disease. [1]   Men  have  higher mortality. [9] SLE significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, with this being the most common cause of death. [6] While women with lupus have higher-risk pregnancies, most are successful. [1]\n\nRate  of  SLE  varies  between  countries  from  20  to  70  per 100,000. [2]  Women of childbearing age are affected about nine times more often than men. [6]  While it most commonly begins between  the  ages  of  15  and  45,  a  wide  range  of  ages  can  be affected.

        "text": "# Signs and symptoms\n\nSLE is one of several diseases known as \"the great imitator\" because it often mimics or is mistaken for other illnesses. [12]  SLE is a classical item in differential diagnosis, [13]  because SLE symptoms vary widely and come and go unpredictably. Diagnosis can thus be elusive, with some people having unexplained symptoms of SLE for years before a definitive diagnosis is reached. [14]\n\nCommon initial and chronic complaints include fever, malaise, joint pains, muscle pains, and fatigue. Because these symptoms are so often seen in association with other diseases, these signs and symptoms are not  part  of  the  diagnostic  criteria  for  SLE.  When  occurring  in conjunction  with  other  signs  and  symptoms,  however,  they  are considered suggestive. [15]\n\nWhile SLE can occur in both males and females, it is found far more often  in  women,  and  the  symptoms  associated  with  each  sex  are different. [9]  Females tend to have a greater number of relapses, a low white  blood  cell  count,  more  arthritis,  Raynaud  syndrome,  and psychiatric  symptoms.  Males  tend  to  have  more  seizures,  kidney\n\ndisease,  serositis  (inflammation  of  tissues  lining  the  lungs  and  heart),  skin  problems,  and  peripheral neuropathy. [16]\n\n\n## Skin\n\nAs many as 70% of people with lupus have some skin symptoms. The three main categories of lesions are chronic cutaneous (discoid) lupus, subacute  cutaneous  lupus,  and  acute  cutaneous  lupus.  People  with discoid  lupus  may  exhibit  thick,  red  scaly  patches  on  the  skin. Similarly, subacute cutaneous lupus manifests as red, scaly patches of skin  but  with  distinct  edges.  Acute  cutaneous  lupus  manifests  as  a rash.  Some  have  the  classic  malar  rash  (commonly  known  as  the butterfly rash ) associated with the disease. [17]  This rash occurs in 3060% of people with SLE. [18]\n\nHair loss, mouth and nasal ulcers, and lesions on the skin are other possible manifestations. [19]\n\n\n## Muscles and bones\n\nThe most commonly sought medical attention is for joint pain, with the  small  joints  of  the  hand  and  wrist  usually  affected,  although  all joints  are  at  risk.  More  than  90  percent  of  those  affected  will experience  joint  or  muscle  pain  at  some  time  during  the  course  of\n\ntheir illness. [20]  Unlike rheumatoid arthritis, lupus arthritis is less disabling and usually does not cause severe destruction of the joints. Fewer than ten percent of people with lupus arthritis will develop deformities of the hands and feet. [20]  People with SLE are at particular risk of developing osteoarticular tuberculosis. [21]\n\nA  possible  association  between  rheumatoid  arthritis  and  SLE  has  been  suggested, [22]   and  SLE  may  be associated with an increased risk of bone fractures in relatively young women.

        "text": "# Blood\n\nAnemia  is  common  in  children  with  SLE [24]   and  develops  in  about 50%  of  cases. [25]   Low  platelet  count  (thrombocytopenia)  and  low white blood cell count (leukopenia) may be due to the disease or a side effect  of  pharmacological  treatment.  People  with  SLE  may  have  an association with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome [26] (a thrombotic  disorder),  wherein  autoantibodies  to  phospholipids  are present in their serum. Abnormalities associated with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome include a paradoxical prolonged partial  thromboplastin  time  (which  usually  occurs  in  hemorrhagic disorders)  and  a  positive  test  for  antiphospholipid  antibodies;  the combination of such findings have earned the term \"lupus anticoagulant-positive\".  Another  autoantibody  finding  in  SLE  is  the\n\nanti-cardiolipin antibody, which can cause a false positive test for syphilis. [27]\n\n\n## Heart\n\nSLE  may  cause  pericarditis (inflammation of the outer lining surrounding the heart), myocarditis (inflammation  of  the  heart  muscle),  or  endocarditis  (inflammation  of  the  inner  lining  of  the  heart).  The endocarditis  of  SLE  is  non-infectious,  and  is  also  called  Libman-Sacks  endocarditis.  It  involves  either  the mitral valve or the tricuspid valve. Atherosclerosis also occurs more often and advances more rapidly than in the general population. [28][29]\n\nSteroids are sometimes prescribed as an anti-inflammatory treatment for lupus; however, they can increase one's risk for heart disease, high cholesterol, and atherosclerosis. [30]\n\n\n## Lungs\n\nSLE can cause pleuritic pain as well as inflammation of the pleurae known as pleurisy, which can rarely give rise  to  shrinking  lung  syndrome  involving  a  reduced  lung  volume. [31][32]   Other  associated  lung  conditions include  pneumonitis,  chronic  diffuse  interstitial  lung  disease,  pulmonary  hypertension,  pulmonary  emboli, and pulmonary hemorrhage. [33][34]\n\n\n## Kidneys\n\nPainless passage of blood or protein in the urine may often be the only presenting sign of kidney involvement. Acute or chronic renal impairment may develop with lupus nephritis, leading to acute or end-stage kidney failure. Because of early recognition and management  of SLE with immunosuppressive drugs or corticosteroids, [35]   end-stage  renal  failure  occurs  in  less  than  5% [36][37]   of  cases,  except  in  the  black population, where the risk is many times higher.\n\nThe histological hallmark of SLE is membranous glomerulonephritis with \"wire loop\" abnormalities. [38]  This finding is due to immune complex deposition along the glomerular basement membrane, leading to a typical granular appearance in immunofluorescence testing.\n\n\n## Neuropsychiatric\n\nNeuropsychiatric  syndromes  can  result  when  SLE  affects  the  central  or  peripheral  nervous  system.  The American College of Rheumatology defines 19 neuropsychiatric syndromes in systemic lupus erythematosus. [39]   The  diagnosis  of  neuropsychiatric  syndromes  concurrent  with  SLE  (now  termed  as NPSLE), [40]   is  one  of  the  most  difficult  challenges  in  medicine,  because  it  can  involve  so  many  different patterns of symptoms, some of which may be mistaken for signs of infectious disease or stroke.

        "text": "A common neurological disorder people with SLE have is headache, [42]  although the existence of a specific lupus headache and the optimal approach to headache in SLE cases remains controversial. [43]  Other common neuropsychiatric manifestations of SLE include cognitive disorder, mood disorder, cerebrovascular disease, [42]  seizures, polyneuropathy, [42]  anxiety disorder, psychosis, depression, and in some extreme cases, personality disorders. [44]  Steroid psychosis can also occur as a result of treating the disease. [40]  It can rarely present  with  intracranial  hypertension  syndrome,  characterized  by  an  elevated  intracranial  pressure, papilledema, and headache with occasional abducens nerve paresis, absence of a space-occupying lesion or ventricular enlargement, and normal cerebrospinal fluid chemical and hematological constituents. [45]\n\nMore  rare manifestations are acute confusional state, Guillain-Barré syndrome,  aseptic meningitis, autonomic  disorder,  demyelinating  syndrome,  mononeuropathy  (which  might  manifest  as  mononeuritis multiplex), movement disorder (more specifically, chorea), myasthenia gravis, myelopathy, cranial neuropathy and plexopathy. [46]\n\nNeurological  disorders  contribute  to  a  significant  percentage  of  morbidity  and  mortality  in  people  with lupus. [47]  As a result, the neural side of lupus is being studied in hopes of reducing morbidity and mortality rates. [39]   One  aspect  of  this  disease  is  severe  damage  to  the  epithelial  cells  of  the  blood-brain  barrier.  In certain regions, depression affects up to 60% of women with SLE. [48]\n\n\n## Eyes\n\nUp  to  one-third  of  patients  report  that  their  eyes  are  affected.  The  most  common  diseases  are  dry  eye syndrome and secondary Sjögren's syndrome, but episcleritis, scleritis, retinopathy (more often affecting both eyes than one), ischemic optic neuropathy, retinal detachment, and secondary angle-closure glaucoma may occur. In addition, the medications used to treat SLE can cause eye disease: long-term glucocorticoid use can cause cataracts and secondary open-angle glaucoma, and long-term hydroxychloroquine treatment can cause vortex keratopathy and maculopathy. [49]\n\n\n## Reproductive\n\nWhile most pregnancies have positive outcomes, there is a greater risk of adverse events occurring during pregnancy. [50]  SLE causes an increased rate of fetal death in utero and spontaneous abortion (miscarriage). The overall live-birth rate in people with SLE has been estimated to be 72%. [51]  Pregnancy outcome appears to be worse in people with SLE whose disease flares up during pregnancy. [52]\n\nNeonatal lupus is the occurrence of SLE symptoms in an infant born from a mother with SLE, most commonly presenting with a rash resembling discoid lupus erythematosus, and sometimes with systemic abnormalities such  as  heart  block  or  enlargement  of  the  liver  and  spleen. [53]   Neonatal  lupus  is  usually  benign  and  selflimited. [53]\n\nMedications for treatment of SLE can carry severe risks for female and male reproduction. Cyclophosphamide (also known as Cytoxan), can lead to infertility by causing premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), the loss of normal function of one's ovaries prior to age forty. [54]  Methotrexate can cause termination or deformity in fetuses  and  is  a  common  abortifacient,  and  for  men  taking  a  high  dose  and  planning  to  father,  a discontinuation period of 6 months is recommended before insemination. [55]\n\n\n## Systemic\n\nFatigue in SLE is probably multifactorial and has been related to not only disease activity or complications such as anemia or hypothyroidism, but also to pain, depression, poor sleep quality, poor physical fitness and lack of social support.

        "text": "# Causes\n\n\n## Vitamin D deficiency\n\nSome  studies  have  found  that  vitamin  D  deficiency  (i.e.,  a  low  serum  level  of  vitamin  D)  often  occurs  in patients with SLE and that its level is particularly low in patients with more active SLE. [58][59]  Furthermore, 5 studies reported that SLE patients treated with vitamin D had significant reductions in the activity of their disease. [60]  However, other studies have found that the levels of vitamin D in SLE are not low, that vitamin D does not reduce their SLE's activity, and/or that the vitamin D levels and responses to vitamin D treatment varied in different patient populations (i.e., varied based on whether the study was conducted on individuals living  in  Africa  or  Europe).  Because  of  these  conflicting  findings,  the  following  middle  ground  has  been proposed for using vitamin D to treat SLE: a) patients  with  SLE  that  have  25-hydroxyvitamin D 2  plus 25hydroxyvitamin D 3  serum levels less than 30 ng/ml should be treated with vitamin D to keep these levels at or above  30  ng/ml  or,  in  patients  having  major  SLE-related  organ  involvement,  at  36  to  40  ng/ml  and b) patients with 25-hydroxyvitamin D 2  plus 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3  levels at or above 30 ng/ml should not be treated with vitamin D unless they have major SLE-related organ involvement in which case they should be treated  with  25-hydroxyvitamin  D 2   plus  25-hydroxyvitamin  D 3   to  maintain  their  serum  vitamin  D  levels between 36 and 40 ng/ml. [61]\n\n\n## Genetics\n\nStudies of identical twins (i.e., twins that develop from the same fertilized egg) and genome-wide association studies  have  identified  numerous  genes  that  by  themselves  promote  the  development  of  SLE,  particularly childhood-onset  SLE,  i.e.,  cSLE,  in  rare  cases  of  SLE/cSLE. [62][63][64]   The  single-gene  (also  termed monogenic) causes of cSLE (or a cSLE-like disorder) develop in individuals before they reach 18 years of age. cSLE  typically  is  more  severe  and  potentially  lethal  than  adult-onset  SLE  because  it  often  involves  SLEinduced neurologic disease, renal failure, and/or the macrophage activation syndrome. [4]  Mutations in about 40 genes have been reported to cause cSLE and/or a cSLE-like disease. [63]  These genes include 5 which as of February, 2024 were classified as inborn errors of immunity genes, i.e., DNASE1L3, TREX1, IFIH1, Tartrateresistant acid phosphatase and PRKCD [65][66][67]  and 28 other genes, i.e., NEIL3, TMEM173, ADAR1, NRAS, SAMHD1, SOS1, FASLG, FAS receptor gene, RAG1, RAG2, DNASE1, SHOC2, KRAS, PTPN11, PTEN, BLK, RNASEH2A,  RNASEH2B,  RNASEH2C,  Complement  component 1qA, Complement component 1qB, Complement component 1r, Complement component 1s, Complement component 2, Complement component 3,  UNC93B1 ,  and  the  two  complement component 4 genes , C4A and C4B . [64][65][68][69]   (The C4A and C4B genes  code  respectively  for  complement  component  A  and  complement  component  B  proteins.  These  two proteins  combine  to  form  the  complement  component  4  protein  which  plays  various  roles  in  regulating immune  function.  Individuals  normally  have  multiple  copies  of  the C4A and C4B gene  but  if  they  have reduced levels of one and/or both of these genes make low levels of complement component 4 protein and thereby are at risk for developing cSLE or a cSLE-like disorders. [70][71] )(Note that mutations in the UNC93B1 gene may cause either cSLE or the chilblain lupus erythematosus form of cSLE. [69] )\n\nMutations in a wide range of other genes do not by themselves cause SLE but two or more of them may act together, act in concert with environmental factors, or act in some but not other populations (e.g., cause SLE in Chinese but not Europeans) to cause SLE or an SLE-like syndrome but do so in only a small percentage of cases. [63][72]  The development of a genetically-regulated trait or disorder that is dependent on the inheritance of two or more genes is termed oligogenic inheritance or polygenic inheritance. [73][74]\n\nSLE is regarded as a prototype disease due to the significant overlap in its symptoms with other autoimmune diseases. [75]\n\nPatients with SLE have higher levels of DNA damage than normal subjects, and several proteins involved in the  preservation  of  genomic  stability  show  polymorphisms,  some  of  which  increase  the  risk  for  SLE development. [76]  Defective DNA repair is a likely mechanism underlying lupus development. [77]"

        "text": "# Drug-induced SLE\n\nDrug-induced lupus erythematosus is a (generally) reversible condition that usually occurs in people being treated for a long-term illness. Drug-induced lupus mimics SLE. However, symptoms of drug-induced lupus generally  disappear  once  the  medication  that  triggered  the  episode  is  stopped. [13][78]   While  there  are  no established criteria for diagnosing drug-induced SLE, most authors have agreed on the following definition: the afflicted patient had a sufficient and continuing exposure to the drug, at least one symptom compatible with SLE, no history suggestive of SLE before starting the drug, and resolution of symptoms within weeks or months after stopping intake of the drug. The VigiBase drug safety data repositor diagnosed 12,166 cases of drug-induced SLE recorded between 1968 and 2017. Among the 118 agents causing SLE, five main classes were  most  often  associated  with  drug-induced  SLE.  These  drugs  were  antiarrhythmic  agents  such  as procainamide or quinidine; antihypertensive agents such as hydralazine, captopril, or acebutolol; antimicrobial agents such as minocycline, isoniazid, carbamazepine, or phenytoin; and agents that inhibit the inflammation-inducing actions of interferon or tumor necrosis factor. [79]\n\n\n## Non-systemic forms of lupus\n\nDiscoid (cutaneous) lupus is limited to skin symptoms and is diagnosed by biopsy of rash on the face, neck, scalp or arms. Approximately 5% of people with DLE progress to SLE. [80]\n\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nSLE is triggered by environmental factors that are unknown. In SLE, the body's immune system produces antibodies against self-protein, particularly against proteins in the cell nucleus. These antibody attacks are the immediate cause of SLE. [13][81][82]\n\nSLE is a chronic inflammatory disease believed to be a type III hypersensitivity response with potential type II involvement. [83]  Reticulate and stellate acral pigmentation should be considered a possible manifestation of SLE and high titers of anti-cardiolipin antibodies, or a consequence of therapy. [84]\n\nPeople with SLE have intense polyclonal B-cell activation, with a population shift towards immature B cells. Memory B cells with increased CD27+/IgD-are less susceptible to immunosuppression. CD27-/IgD- memory B cells are associated with increased disease activity and renal lupus. T cells, which regulate B-cell responses and  infiltrate  target  tissues,  have  defects  in  signaling,  adhesion,  co-stimulation,  gene  transcription,  and alternative  splicing.  The  cytokines  B-lymphocyte  stimulator  (BLyS),  also  known  as  B-cell  activating  factor (BAFF), interleukin 6, interleukin 17, interleukin 18, type I interferons, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) are involved in the inflammatory process and are potential therapeutic targets. [6][85][86]\n\nSLE is associated with low C3 levels in the complement system. [87]\n\n\n## Cell death signaling\n\n\n- Apoptosis is increased in monocytes and keratinocytes\n- Expression of Fas by B cells and T cells is increased\n- There are correlations between the apoptotic rates of lymphocytes and disease activity.\n- Necrosis is increased in T lymphocytes.\n\n\nTingible  body  macrophages  (TBMs)  -  large  phagocytic  cells  in  the  germinal  centers  of  secondary  lymph nodes  -  express  CD68  protein.  These  cells  normally  engulf  B  cells  that  have  undergone  apoptosis  after somatic  hypermutation.  In  some  people  with  SLE,  significantly  fewer  TBMs  can  be  found,  and  these  cells rarely  contain  material  from  apoptotic  B  cells.  Also,  uningested  apoptotic  nuclei  can  be  found  outside  of TBMs.  This  material  may  present  a  threat  to  the  tolerization  of  B  cells  and  T  cells.  Dendritic  cells  in  the germinal  center  may  endocytose  such  antigenic  material  and  present  it  to  T  cells,  activating  them.  Also, apoptotic chromatin and nuclei may attach to the surfaces of follicular dendritic cells and make this material available for activating other B cells that may have randomly acquired self-protein specificity through somatic hypermutation. [88]   Necrosis,  a  pro-inflammatory  form  of  cell  death,  is  increased  in  T  lymphocytes,  due  to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and depletion of ATP. [89]"

        "text": "# Clearance deficiency\n\nImpaired  clearance  of  dying  cells  is  a  potential  pathway  for  the development  of  this  systemic  autoimmune  disease.  This  includes deficient  phagocytic  activity,  impaired  lysosomal  degradation,  and scant serum components in addition to increased apoptosis. [90]\n\nSLE  is associated with defects in apoptotic clearance,  and  the damaging  effects  caused  by  apoptotic  debris.  Early  apoptotic  cells express \"eat-me\" signals, of cell-surface proteins such as phosphatidylserine, that prompt immune  cells to engulf them. Apoptotic  cells  also  express  find-me  signals  to  attract  macrophages and dendritic cells. When apoptotic material is not removed correctly by phagocytes, they are captured instead by antigen-presenting cells, which leads to the development of antinuclear antibodies. [6]\n\nMonocytes  isolated  from  whole  blood  of  people  with  SLE  show reduced  expression  of  CD44  surface  molecules  involved  in  the  uptake  of  apoptotic  cells.  Most  of  the monocytes and tingible body macrophages (TBMs), which are found in the germinal centres of lymph nodes, even show a definitely different morphology; they are smaller or scarce and die earlier. Serum components like complement factors, CRP, and some glycoproteins are, furthermore, decisively important for an efficiently operating phagocytosis. With SLE, these components are often missing, diminished, or inefficient. [90]\n\nMacrophages  during  SLE  fail  to  mature  their  lysosomes  and  as  a  result  have  impaired  degradation  of internalized apoptotic debris, which results in chronic activation of Toll-like receptors and permeabilization of the phagolysosomal membrane, allowing activation of cytosolic sensors. In addition, intact apoptotic debris recycles back to the cell membrane and accumulate on the surface of the cell. [91][92]\n\nRecent  research  has  found  an  association  between  certain  people  with  lupus  (especially  those  with  lupus nephritis) and an impairment in degrading neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). These were due to DNAse1 inhibiting  factors,  or  NET  protecting  factors  in  people's  serum,  rather  than  abnormalities  in  the  DNAse1 itself. [93]  DNAse1 mutations in lupus have so far only been found in some Japanese cohorts. [94]\n\nThe  clearance  of  early  apoptotic  cells  is  an  important  function  in  multicellular  organisms.  It  leads  to  a progression of the apoptosis process and finally to secondary necrosis of the cells if this ability is disturbed. Necrotic cells release nuclear fragments as potential autoantigens, as well as internal danger signals, inducing maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) since they have lost their membranes' integrity. Increased appearance of apoptotic  cells  also  stimulates  inefficient  clearance.  That  leads  to  the  maturation  of  DCs  and  also  to  the presentation of intracellular antigens of late apoptotic or secondary necrotic cells, via MHC molecules. [95]\n\nAutoimmunity possibly results from the extended exposure to nuclear and intracellular autoantigens derived from late apoptotic and secondary necrotic cells. B and T cell tolerance for apoptotic cells is abrogated, and the lymphocytes get activated by these autoantigens; inflammation and the production of autoantibodies by plasma cells is initiated. A clearance deficiency in the skin for apoptotic cells has also been observed in people with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE). [95]\n\n\n## Germinal centers\n\nIn healthy conditions, apoptotic lymphocytes are removed in germinal centers (GC) by specialized phagocytes, the tingible body macrophages (TBM), which is why no free apoptotic and potential autoantigenic material can be seen. In some people with SLE, a buildup of apoptotic debris can be observed in GC because of an"

Close  to  TBM, follicular  dendritic  cells  (FDC)  are  localised  in  GC, which  attach  antigen  material  to  their  surface  and,  in contrast to bone marrow-derived DC, neither take it up nor present it via MHC molecules. [96]\n\nAutoreactive  B  cells  can  accidentally  emerge  during somatic  hypermutation  and  migrate  into  the  germinal center light zone. Autoreactive B cells, maturated coincidentally, normally do not receive survival signals by  antigen  planted  on  follicular  dendritic  cells  and perish by apoptosis. In the case of clearance deficiency, apoptotic  nuclear  debris  accumulates  in  the  light  zone of GC and gets attached to FDC. [96]\n\nThis  serves  as  a  germinal  centre  survival  signal  for autoreactive  B-cells.  After  migration  into  the  mantle zone, autoreactive B cells require further survival signals from autoreactive helper T cells, which promote the maturation of autoantibody-producing plasma cells and B memory cells. In the presence of autoreactive T cells, a chronic autoimmune disease may be the consequence. [96][97]\n\n\n## Anti-nRNP autoimmunity\n\nAnti-nRNP  autoantibodies  to  nRNP  A  and  nRNP  C initially targeted restricted, proline-rich motifs. Antibody binding subsequently spread to other epitopes.  The  similarity  and  cross-reactivity  between the  initial  targets  of  nRNP  and  Sm  autoantibodies identifies  a  likely  commonality  in  cause  and  a  focal point for intermolecular epitope spreading. [98]\n\n\n## Others\n\nElevated expression of HMGB1 was found in the sera of people and mice with systemic lupus erythematosus, high  mobility  group  box  1  (HMGB1)  is  a  nuclear  protein  participating  in  chromatin  architecture  and transcriptional regulation. Recently, there is increasing evidence HMGB1 contributes to the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune  diseases due to its inflammatory and immune  stimulating properties. [99]\n\n\n## Diagnosis\n\n\n## Laboratory tests\n\nAntinuclear  antibody  (ANA)  testing  and  anti-extractable  nuclear  antigen  (anti-ENA)  form  the  mainstay  of serologic testing for SLE. ANA testing for lupus is highly sensitive, with the vast majority of individuals with Lupus  testing  positive;  but  the  test  is  not  specific,  as  a  positive  result  may  or  may  not  be  indicative  of Lupus.

        "text": "Several techniques are used to detect ANAs. The most widely used is indirect immunofluorescence (IF). The pattern of fluorescence suggests  the  type  of  antibody  present  in  the  people's  serum.  Direct immunofluorescence  can  detect  deposits  of  immunoglobulins  and complement proteins in people's skin. When skin not exposed to the sun  is  tested,  a  positive  direct  IF  (the  so-called  lupus  band  test)  is evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus. [101]\n\nANA  screening  yields  positive  results  in  many  connective  tissue disorders and other autoimmune diseases, and may occur in normal individuals. Subtypes of antinuclear antibodies include anti-Smith and anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies (which are linked to SLE) and anti-histone antibodies (which are linked to drug-induced lupus).  Anti-dsDNA  antibodies  are  highly  specific  for  SLE;  they  are present in 70% of cases, whereas they appear in only 0.5% of people without SLE. [13]\n\nLaboratory  tests  can  also  help  distinguish  between  closely  related connective tissue diseases. A multianalyte panel (MAP) of autoantibodies, including ANA, anti-dsDNA, and anti-Smith in combination with the measurement of cell-bound complement activation  products  (CB-CAPs)  with  an  integrated  algorithm  has demonstrated  80%  diagnostic  sensitivity and  86%  specificity in differentiating  diagnosed  SLE  from  other  autoimmune  connective tissue  diseases. [102]   The  MAP  approach  has  been  further  studied  in over 40,000 patients tested with either the MAP or traditional ANA testing strategy (tANA), demonstrating patients who test  MAP positive  are  at  up  to  6-fold  increased  odds  of  receiving  a  new  SLE diagnosis  and  up  to  3-fold  increased  odds  of  starting  a  new  SLE medication regimen as compared to patients testing positive with the tANA approach. [103]\n\nThe  anti-dsDNA  antibody  titers  also  tend  to  reflect  disease  activity, although not in all cases. [13]  Other ANA that may occur in people with SLE  are  anti-U1  RNP  (which  also  appears  in  systemic  sclerosis  and\n\nmixed connective tissue disease), SS-A (or anti-Ro) and SS-B (or anti-La; both of which are more common in Sjögren's syndrome). SS-A and SS-B confer a specific risk for heart conduction block in neonatal lupus. [104]\n\nOther  tests  routinely  performed  in  suspected  SLE  are  complement  system  levels  (low  levels  suggest consumption by the immune system), electrolytes and kidney function (disturbed if the kidney is involved), liver enzymes, and complete blood count. [105]\n\nThe lupus erythematosus (LE) cell test was commonly used for diagnosis, but it is no longer used because the LE cells  are  only  found  in  50-75%  of  SLE  cases  and  they  are  also  found  in  some  people  with  rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, and drug sensitivities. Because of this, the LE cell test is now performed only rarely and is mostly of historical significance. [106]\n\n\n## Diagnostic criteria\n\nSome  physicians  make  a  diagnosis  based  on  the  American  College  of  Rheumatology  (ACR)  classification criteria. However, these criteria were primarily established for use in scientific research, including selection for randomized controlled trials, which require higher confidence levels. As a result, many people with SLE may not meet the full ACR criteria. [107]"

They were not intended to be used to diagnose individuals and do not do well in that capacity. For the purpose of identifying people for clinical studies, a person has SLE if any 4 out of 11 symptoms are present simultaneously or serially on two separate occasions.\n\n\n- Malar rash (rash on cheeks); sensitivity = 57%; specificity = 96%. [ 110]\n- Discoid rash (red, scaly patches on skin that cause scarring); sensitivity = 18%; specificity = 99%. [ 110]\n- Serositis: Pleurisy (inflammation of the membrane around the lungs) or pericarditis (inflammation of the membrane around the heart); sensitivity = 56%; specificity = 86% (pleural is more sensitive; cardiac is more specific). [ 110]\n- Oral ulcers (includes oral or nasopharyngeal ulcers); sensitivity = 27%; specificity = 96%. [ 110]\n- Arthritis: nonerosive arthritis of two or more peripheral joints, with tenderness, swelling, or effusion; sensitivity = 86%; specificity = 37%. [ 110]\n- Photosensitivity (exposure to ultraviolet light causes rash, or other symptoms of SLE flareups); sensitivity = 43%; specificity = 96%. [ 110]\n- Blood-hematologic disorder-hemolytic anemia (low red blood cell count), leukopenia (white blood cell count<4000/μL), lymphopenia (<1500/μL), or low platelet count (<100000/μL) in the absence of offending drug; sensitivity = 59%; specificity = 89%. [ 110]  Hypocomplementemia is also seen, due to either consumption of C3 [111]  and C4 by immune complex-induced inflammation or to congenitally complement deficiency, which may predispose to SLE.\n- Renal disorder: More than 0.5 g per day protein in urine or cellular casts seen in urine under a microscope; sensitivity = 51%; specificity = 94%. [ 110]\n- Antinuclear antibody test positive; sensitivity = 99%; specificity = 49%.

[ 110] Presence of anti-ss DNA in 70% of cases (though also positive with rheumatic disease and healthy persons). [ 112]\n- Neurologic disorder: Seizures or psychosis; sensitivity = 20%; specificity = 98%. [ 110] Other than the ACR criteria, people with lupus may also have: [113]\n- Fever (over 100 °F/ 37.7 °C)\n- Extreme fatigue\n- Hair loss\n- Fingers turning white or blue when cold (Raynaud syndrome)\n\n\n\n## Criteria for individual diagnosis\n\nSome  people,  especially  those  with  antiphospholipid  syndrome,  may  have  SLE  without  four  of  the  above criteria, and also SLE may present with features other than those listed in the criteria. [114][115][116]\n\n\nRecursive partitioning has been used to identify more parsimonious criteria. [110]  This analysis presented two diagnostic classification trees:\n- Simplest classification tree: SLE is diagnosed if a person has an immunologic disorder (anti-DNA antibody, anti-Smith antibody, false positive syphilis test, or LE cells) or malar rash. It has sensitivity = 92% and specificity = 92%.\n- Full classifi cation tree: Uses six criteria. It has sensitivity = 97% and specificity = 95%."

        "text": "# Other alternative criteria have been suggested, e.g. the St. Thomas' Hospital \"alternative\" criteria in 1998. [117]\n\n\n## Treatment\n\nThere is no cure for Lupus. The treatment of SLE involves preventing flares and reducing their severity and duration when they occur. [118]\n\nHydroxychloroquine was approved by the FDA for lupus in 1955. [119]  Hydroxychloroquine is a first line agent for SLE and is associated with reduced mortality, complications and disease activity. Hydroxychloroquiine is associated with a 54% reduction in mortality due to SLE. [120][121]  It is recommended that all people with SLE be on hydroxychloroquine regardless of disease activity due to its well documented benefits, unless there are contraindications to its use. [121]  Contraindications to hydroxychloroquine include allergy to the medication or significant  retinal  disease  (as  hydroxychloroquine  may  worsen  retinopathy).  Regular  eye  exams  are recommended for those on hydroxychloroquine chronically due to this rare risk. [121]  The prevalence of retinal toxicity for those on the medication was 2% at 10 years. [121]\n\nTreatment can include corticosteroids and anti-malarial drugs. Certain types of lupus nephritis such as diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis require intermittent cytotoxic drugs. These drugs include cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate. Cyclophosphamide increases the risk of developing infections, pancreas problems, high blood sugar, and high blood pressure. [122]\n\nSome drugs approved for other diseases are  used  for  SLE  'off-label'.  In  November  2010,  an  FDA  advisory panel recommended approving belimumab (Benlysta) as a treatment for the pain and flare-ups common in lupus. The drug was approved by the FDA in March 2011. [123][124]\n\nIn terms of healthcare utilization and costs, one study found that \"patients from the US with SLE, especially individuals with moderate or severe disease, utilize significant healthcare resources and incur high medical costs.\" [125]\n\n\n## Medications\n\nDue to the variety of symptoms and organ system involvement with SLE, its severity in an individual must be assessed  to  successfully  treat  SLE.  Mild  or  remittent  disease  may,  sometimes,  be  safely  left  untreated.  If required,  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  and  antimalarials  may  be  used.  Medications  such  as prednisone, mycophenolic acid and tacrolimus have been used in the past. [126]\n\n\n## Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs\n\nDisease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are used preventively to reduce the incidence of flares, the progress of the disease, and the need for steroid use; when flares occur, they are treated with corticosteroids. DMARDs  commonly  in  use  are  antimalarials  such  as  hydroxychloroquine  and  immunosuppressants  (e.g. methotrexate and azathioprine). Hydroxychloroquine is an FDA-approved antimalarial used for constitutional,  cutaneous,  and  articular  manifestations.  Hydroxychloroquine  has  relatively  few  side  effects, and there is evidence that it improves survival among people who have SLE. [119]  Cyclophosphamide is used for severe glomerulonephritis or other organ-damaging complications. Mycophenolic acid is also used for the treatment of lupus nephritis, but it is not FDA-approved for this indication, and FDA is investigating reports that it may be associated with birth defects when used by pregnant women. [127]  A study involving more than 1,000  people  with  lupus  found  that  people  have  a  similar  risk  of  serious  infection  with  azathioprine  and mycophenolic acid as with newer biological therapies (rituximab and belimumab). [128][129]\n\n\n## Immunosuppressive drugs\n\nIn  more  severe  cases,  medications  that  modulate  the  immune  system  (primarily  corticosteroids  and immunosuppressants) are used to control the disease and prevent recurrence of symptoms (known as flares). Depending on the dosage, people who require steroids may develop Cushing's syndrome, symptoms of which may  include  obesity,  puffy  round  face,  diabetes  mellitus,  increased  appetite,  difficulty  sleeping,  and osteoporosis. These may subside if and when the large initial dosage is reduced, but long-term use of even low doses can cause elevated blood pressure and cataracts. [130]"

        "text": "Numerous new immunosuppressive drugs are being actively tested for SLE. Rather than broadly suppressing the immune system, as corticosteroids do, they target the responses of specific types of immune cells. Some of these drugs are already FDA-approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, however due to high-toxicity, their use remains limited. [119][131]\n\n\n# Analgesia\n\nSince  a  large  percentage  of  people  with  SLE  have  varying  amounts  of  chronic  pain,  stronger  prescription analgesics (painkillers) may be used if over-the-counter drugs (mainly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) do not provide effective relief. Potent NSAIDs  such  as  indomethacin  and  diclofenac  are  relatively contraindicated for people with SLE because they increase the risk of kidney failure and heart failure. [119]\n\nPain is typically treated with opioids, varying in potency based on the severity of symptoms. When opioids are used for prolonged periods, drug tolerance, chemical dependency, and addiction may occur. Opiate addiction is  not  typically  a  concern  since  the  condition  is  not  likely  to  ever  completely  disappear.  Thus,  lifelong treatment with opioids is fairly common for chronic pain symptoms, accompanied by periodic titration that is typical of any long-term opioid regimen. [132]\n\n\n## Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs)\n\nIntravenous immunoglobulins may be used to control SLE with organ involvement, or vasculitis. It is believed that  they  reduce  antibody production or promote the clearance of immune complexes from the body, even though their mechanism of action is not well understood. [133] Unlike immunosuppressives and corticosteroids, IVIGs do not suppress the immune system, so there is less risk of serious infections with these drugs. [134]\n\n\n## Lifestyle changes\n\nAvoiding sunlight in SLE is critical since ultraviolet radiation is known to exacerbate skin manifestations of the disease. [135]  Avoiding activities that induce fatigue is also important since those with SLE fatigue easily and it can be debilitating. These two problems can lead to people becoming housebound for long periods of time. Physical exercise has been shown to help improve fatigue in adult with SLE. [135]  Drugs unrelated to SLE should  be  prescribed  only  when  known  not  to  exacerbate  the  disease.  Occupational  exposure  to  silica, pesticides,  and  mercury  can  also  worsen  the  disease. [85]   Recommendations  for  evidence  based  nonpharmacological interventions in the management of SLE have been developed by an international task force of clinicians and patients with SLE. [135]\n\n\n## Kidney transplantation\n\nKidney transplants are the treatment of choice for end-stage kidney disease, which is one of the complications of lupus nephritis, but the recurrence of the full disease is common in up to 30% of people. [136]\n\n\n## Antiphospholipid syndrome\n\nApproximately 20% of people with SLE have clinically significant levels of antiphospholipid antibodies, which are associated with antiphospholipid syndrome. [137]  Antiphospholipid syndrome is also related to the onset of neural  lupus  symptoms  in  the  brain.  In  this  form  of  the  disease,  the  cause  is  very  different  from  lupus: thromboses (blood clots or \"sticky blood\") form in blood vessels, which prove to be fatal if they move within the bloodstream. [114]  If the thromboses migrate to the brain, they can potentially cause a stroke by blocking the blood supply to the brain."

        "text": "If this disorder is suspected in people, brain scans are usually required for early detection. These scans can show localized areas of the brain where blood supply has not been adequate. The treatment plan for these people  requires  anticoagulation.  Often,  low-dose  aspirin  is  prescribed  for  this  purpose,  although  for  cases involving thrombosis anticoagulants such as warfarin are used. [138]\n\n\n# Management of pregnancy\n\nWhile most infants born to mothers who have SLE are healthy, pregnant mothers with SLE should remain under medical care until delivery. However, SLE in the pregnant mother poses a higher risk of neonatal lupus, intrauterine  growth  restriction,  preterm  membrane  rupture,  preterm  birth,  and  miscarriage. [139]   Neonatal lupus is rare, but identification of mothers at the highest risk for complications allows for prompt treatment before or after birth. In addition, SLE can flare up during pregnancy, and proper treatment can maintain the health of the mother longer. Women pregnant and known to have anti-Ro (SSA) or anti-La antibodies (SSB) often have echocardiograms during the 16th and 30th weeks of pregnancy to monitor the health of the heart and surrounding vasculature. [140]\n\nContraception and other reliable forms of pregnancy prevention are routinely advised for women with SLE since  getting  pregnant  during  active  disease  was  found  to  be  harmful. [141]   Lupus  nephritis,  gestational diabetes, and pre-eclampsia are common manifestations. [139]\n\n\n## Prognosis\n\nNo cure is available for SLE but there are many treatments for the disease. [1]\n\nIn the 1950s, most people diagnosed with SLE lived fewer than five years. Today, over 90% now survive for more than ten years, and many live relatively symptom-free. 80-90% can expect to live a normal lifespan. [142] Mortality rates are however elevated compared to people without SLE. [143]\n\nPrognosis is typically worse for men and children than for women; however, if symptoms are present after age 60, the disease tends to run a more benign course. Early mortality, within five years, is due to organ failure or overwhelming infections, both of which can be altered by early diagnosis and treatment. The mortality risk is fivefold when compared to the normal population in the late stages, which can be attributed to cardiovascular disease from accelerated atherosclerosis, the leading cause of death for people with SLE. [119]  To reduce the potential for cardiovascular issues, high blood pressure and high cholesterol should be prevented or treated aggressively. Steroids should be used at the lowest dose for the shortest possible period, and other drugs that can reduce symptoms should be used whenever possible. [119]\n\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nThe global rates of SLE are approximately 20-70 per 100,000 people. In females, the rate is highest between 45 and 64 years of age. The lowest overall rate exists in Iceland and Japan. The highest rates exist in the US and France. However, there is not sufficient evidence to conclude why SLE is less common in some countries compared  to  others;  it  could  be  the  environmental  variability  in  these  countries.  For  example,  different countries  receive  different  levels  of  sunlight,  and  exposure  to  UV  rays  affects  dermatological  symptoms  of SLE. [2]\n\nCertain  studies  hypothesize  that  a  genetic  connection  exists  between  race  and  lupus  which  affects  disease prevalence. If this is true, the racial composition of countries affects disease and will cause the incidence in a country  to  change  as  the  racial  makeup  changes.  To  understand  if  this  is  true,  countries  with  largely homogenous and  racially  stable  populations  should  be  studied  to  better  understand  incidence. [2]   Rates  of disease in the developing world are unclear. [10]"

        "text": "The rate of SLE varies between countries, ethnicity, and sex, and changes over time. [138]  In the United States, one estimate of the rate of SLE is 53 per 100,000; [138]  another estimate places the total affected population at 322,000 to over 1 million (98 to over 305 per 100,000). [144]  In Northern Europe the rate is about 40 per 100,000  people. [13]   SLE  occurs  more  frequently  and  with  greater  severity  among  those  of  non-European descent. [144]   That  rate  has  been  found  to  be  as  high  as  159  per  100,000  among  those  of  Afro-Caribbean descent. [138]  Childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus generally presents between the ages of 3 and 15 and is four times more common in girls. [145]\n\nWhile the onset and persistence of SLE can show disparities between genders, socioeconomic status also plays a major role. Women with SLE and of lower socioeconomic status have been shown to have higher depression scores,  higher  body  mass  index,  and  more  restricted  access  to  medical  care  than  women  of  higher socioeconomic  statuses  with  the  illness.  People  with  SLE  had  more  self-reported  anxiety  and  depression scores if they were from a lower socioeconomic status. [146]\n\n\n# Race\n\nThere are assertions that race affects the rate of SLE. However, a 2010 review of studies that correlate race and  SLE  identified  several  sources  of  systematic  and  methodological  error,  indicating  that  the  connection between race and SLE may be spurious. [147]  For example, studies show that social support is a modulating factor which buffers against SLE-related damage and maintains physiological functionality. [147]  Studies have not  been  conducted to determine whether people of different racial backgrounds receive differing levels of social support. [147]  If there is a difference, this could act as a confounding variable in studies correlating race and SLE.\n\nAnother  caveat  to  note  when  examining  studies  about  SLE  is  that  symptoms  are  often  self-reported.  This process introduces additional sources of methodological error. Studies have shown that self-reported data is affected by more than just the patient's experience with the disease- social support, the level of helplessness, and abnormal illness-related behaviors also factor into a self-assessment. Additionally, other factors like the degree of social support that a person receives, socioeconomic status, health insurance, and access to care can contribute to an individual's disease progression. [147][148]\n\nRacial  differences  in  lupus  progression  have  not  been  found  in  studies  that  control  for  the  socioeconomic status [SES] of participants. [147][149]  Studies that control for the SES of its participants have found that nonwhite people have more abrupt disease onset compared to white people and that their disease progresses more quickly.  Non-white  patients  often  report  more  hematological,  serosal,  neurological,  and  renal  symptoms. However, the severity of symptoms and mortality are both similar in white and non-white patients. Studies that  report  different  rates  of  disease  progression  in  late-stage  SLE  are  most  likely  reflecting  differences  in socioeconomic status and the corresponding access to care. [147]   The  people  who  receive  medical  care  have often  accrued  less  disease-related  damage  and  are  less  likely  to  be  below  the  poverty  line. [149]   Additional studies have found that education, marital status, occupation, and income create a social context that affects disease progression. [147]\n\n\n## Sex\n\nSLE,  like  many  autoimmune  diseases,  affects  females  more  frequently  than  males,  at  a  rate  of  about  9  to 1. [9][138]\n\nHormonal mechanisms could explain the increased incidence of SLE in females. The onset of SLE could be attributed  to  the  elevated  hydroxylation  of  estrogen  and  the  abnormally  decreased  levels  of  androgens  in females. In addition, differences in GnRH signalling have also been shown to contribute to the onset of SLE. While  females  are  more  likely  to  relapse  than  males,  the  intensity  of  these  relapses  is  the  same  for  both sexes. [16]"

        "text": "In  addition  to  hormonal  mechanisms,  specific  genetic  influences  found  on  the  X  chromosome  may  also contribute to the development of SLE. The X chromosome carries immunologic genes like CD40L , which can mutate or simply escape silencing by X-chromosome inactivation and contribute to the onset of SLE. [150][151] A  study  has  shown  an  association  between  Klinefelter  syndrome  and  SLE.  XXY  males  with  SLE  have  an abnormal X-Y translocation resulting in the partial triplication of the PAR1 gene region. [152]  Research has also implicated XIST , which encodes a long non-coding RNA that coats the inactive member of the pair of X chromosomes in females as part of a ribonucleoprotein complex, as a source of autoimmunity. [153]\n\n\n# Changing rate of disease\n\nThe rate of SLE in the United States increased from 1.0 in 1955 to 7.6 in 1974. Whether the increase is due to better diagnosis or an increased frequency of the disease is unknown. [138]\n\n\n## History\n\nThe  history  of  SLE  can  be  divided  into  three  periods:  classical, neoclassical, and modern. In each period, research and documentation  advanced  the  understanding  and  diagnosis  of  SLE, leading to its classification as an autoimmune disease in 1851, and to the various diagnostic options and treatments now available to people with SLE. The advances made by medical science in the diagnosis and treatment of SLE have dramatically improved the life expectancy of a person diagnosed with SLE. [155]\n\n\n## Etymology\n\nThere are several explanations ventured for the term lupus erythematosus. Lupus is Latin for \"wolf\", [156][5]  and in Medieval Latin was also used to refer to a disease of the skin, [157] and \"erythematosus\" is derived from ἐ ρύθημα, Ancient Greek for \"redness of  the  skin\".  All  explanations  originate  with  the  reddish,  butterflyshaped malar rash that the disease classically exhibits across the nose and  cheeks.  The  reason  the  term  lupus  was  used  to  describe  this disease comes from the mid-19th century. Many diseases that caused ulceration or necrosis were given the term \"lupus\" due to the wound being  reminiscent  of  a  wolf's  bite.  This  is  similar  to  the  naming  of\n\nlupus vulgaris or chronic facial tuberculosis, where the lesions are ragged and punched out and are said to resemble the bite of a wolf. [158]\n\n\n## Classical period\n\nThe  classical  period  began  when  the  disease  was  first  recognized  in  the  Middle  Ages.  The  term  lupus  is attributed to 12th-century Italian physician Rogerius Frugard, who used it to describe ulcerating sores on the legs of people. [159]  No formal treatment for the disease existed and the resources available to physicians to help people were limited. [160]\n\n\n## Neoclassical period\n\nThe  neoclassical  period  began  in  1851  when  the  skin  disease  which  is  now  known  as  discoid  lupus  was documented by the French physician, Pierre Cazenave. Cazenave termed the illness lupus and added the word erythematosus  to  distinguish  this  disease  from  other  illnesses  that  affected  the  skin  except  they  were infectious. [161]  Cazenave observed the disease in several people and made very detailed notes to assist others in its diagnosis. He was one of the first to document that lupus affected adults from adolescence into the early thirties and that facial rash is its most distinguishing feature. [162]"

        "text": "Research and documentation of the disease continued in the neoclassical period with the work of Ferdinand von Hebra and his son-in-law, Moritz Kaposi. They documented the physical effects of lupus as well as some insights into the possibility that the disease caused internal trauma. Von Hebra observed that lupus symptoms could last many years and that the disease could go \"dormant\" after years of aggressive activity and then reappear  with  symptoms  following  the  same  general  pattern.  These  observations  led  Hebra  to  term  lupus  a chronic disease in 1872. [163]\n\nKaposi observed that lupus assumed two forms: the skin lesions (now known as discoid lupus) and a more aggravated form that affected not only the skin but also caused fever, arthritis, and other systemic disorders in people. [164]   The  latter  also  presented  a  rash  confined  to  the  face,  appearing  on  the  cheeks  and  across  the bridge of the nose; he called this the \"butterfly rash\". Kaposi also observed those patients who developed the butterfly rash were often afflicted with another disease such as tuberculosis, anemia, or chlorisis which often caused  death. [162]   Kaposi  was  one  of  the  first  people  to  recognize  what  is  now  termed  systemic  lupus erythematosus in his documentation of the remitting and relapsing nature of the disease and the relationship of skin and systemic manifestations during disease activity. [165]\n\nThe 19th century's research into lupus continued with the work of Sir William Osler who, in 1895, published the first of his three papers about the internal complications of erythema exudativum multiforme. Not all the patient  cases  in  his  paper  had  SLE  but  Osler's  work  expanded  the  knowledge  of  systemic  diseases  and documented extensive and critical visceral complications for several diseases including lupus. [162]  Noting that many people with lupus had a disease that not only affected the skin but many other organs in the body as well, Osler added the word \"systemic\" to the term lupus erythematosus to distinguish this type of disease from discoid lupus erythematosus. [166]\n\nOsler's  second  paper  noted  that  reoccurrence  is  a  special  feature  of  the  disease  and  that  attacks  can  be sustained  for  months  or  even  years.  Further  study  of  the  disease  led  to  a  third  paper,  published  in  1903, documenting  afflictions  such  as  arthritis,  pneumonia,  the  inability  to  form  coherent  ideas,  delirium,  and central nervous system damage as all affecting patients diagnosed with SLE. [162]\n\n\n## Modern period\n\nThe modern period, beginning in 1920, saw major developments in research into the cause and treatment of discoid and systemic lupus. Research conducted in the 1920s and 1930s led to the first detailed pathologic descriptions  of  lupus  and  demonstrated  how  the  disease  affected  the  kidney,  heart,  and  lung  tissue. [167]   A breakthrough was made in 1948 with the discovery of the LE cell (the lupus erythematosus cell-a misnomer, as  it  occurs  with  other  diseases  as  well).  Discovered  by  a  team  of  researchers  at  the  Mayo  Clinic,  they discovered that the white blood cells contained the nucleus of another cell that was pushing against the white cell's proper nucleus. [168]\n\nNoting that the invading nucleus was coated with antibody that allowed it to be ingested by a phagocytic or scavenger cell, they named the antibody that causes one cell to ingest another the LE factor and the two nuclei cell  result  in  the  LE  cell. [169]   The  LE  cell,  it  was  determined, was a part of an anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) reaction; the body produces antibodies against its own tissue. This discovery led to one of the first definitive tests for lupus since LE cells are found in approximately 60% of all people diagnosed with lupus. [170]  The LE cell test is rarely performed as a definitive lupus test today as LE cells do not always occur in people with SLE and can occur in individuals with other autoimmune diseases. Their presence can help establish a diagnosis but no longer indicates a definitive SLE diagnosis.\n\nThe  discovery  of  the  LE  cell  led  to  further  research  and  this  resulted  in  more  definitive  tests  for  lupus. Building on the knowledge that those with SLE had auto-antibodies that would attach themselves to the nuclei of normal cells, causing the immune system to send white blood cells to fight off these \"invaders\", a test was developed to look for the anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) rather than the LE cell specifically. This ANA test was easier to perform and led not only to a definitive diagnosis of lupus but also many other related diseases. This discovery led to the understanding of what is now known as autoimmune diseases. [171]"

        "text": "To  ensure  that  the  person  has  lupus  and  not  another  autoimmune  disease,  the  American  College  of Rheumatology (ACR) established a list of clinical and immunologic criteria that, in any combination, point to SLE. The criteria include symptoms that the person can identify (e.g. pain) and things that a physician can detect in a physical examination and through laboratory test results. The list was originally compiled in 1971, initially revised in 1982, and further revised and improved in 2009. [172]\n\nMedical  historians  have  theorized  that  people  with  porphyria  (a  disease  that  shares  many  symptoms  with SLE) generated folklore stories of vampires and werewolves, due to the photosensitivity, scarring, hair growth, and  porphyrin  brownish-red  stained  teeth  in  severe  recessive  forms  of  porphyria  (or  combinations  of  the disorder, known as dual, homozygous, or compound heterozygous porphyrias). [173]\n\nUseful  medication  for  the  disease  was  first  found  in  1894  when  quinine  was  first  reported  as  an  effective therapy. Four years later, the use of salicylates in conjunction with quinine was noted to be of still greater benefit.  This  was  the  best  available  treatment  until  the  middle  of  the  twentieth  century  when  Hench discovered the efficacy of corticosteroids in the treatment of SLE. [173]\n\n\n## Research\n\nA  study  called  BLISS-76  tested  the  drug  belimumab,  a  fully  human  monoclonal  anti-BAFF  (or  anti-BLyS) antibody. [124]   BAFF  stimulates  and  extends  the  life  of  B  lymphocytes,  which  produce  antibodies  against foreign and self-protein. [174]  It was approved by the FDA in March 2011. [123]  Genetically engineered immune cells are also being studied in animal models of the disease as of 2019. [175]\n\nIn September 2022, researchers at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg published promising results using genetically altered immune cells to treat severely ill patients. Four women and one man received transfusions of CAR T cells modified to attack their B cells, eliminating the aberrant ones. The therapy drove the disease into remission in all five patients, who have been off lupus medication for several months after the treatment ended.
