[1]  It typically occurs in the skin, but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines, or eye (uveal melanoma). [1][2]  In very rare cases melanoma can also happen in the lung,  which  is  known  as  primary  pulmonary  melanoma  and  only happens in 0.01% of primary lung tumors. [7]\n\nIn  women,  melanomas  most  commonly  occur  on  the  legs;  while  in men, on the back. [2]  Melanoma is frequently referred to as malignant melanoma .  However,  the  medical  community  stresses  that  there  is no such thing as a 'benign melanoma' and recommends that the term 'malignant melanoma' should be avoided as redundant. [8][9][10]\n\nAbout 30% of melanomas develop from moles. [11]  Changes in a mole that can indicate melanoma include increase-especially rapid increase -in size, irregular edges, change in color, itchiness, or skin breakdown. [1]",

[20][21]   Melanoma  can  also  occur  in  skin  areas  with  little  sun  exposure  (i.e.,  mouth,  soles  of  feet,  palms  of hands,  genital  areas). [22]   People  with  dysplastic  nevus  syndrome,  also  known  as  familial  atypical  multiple  mole melanoma, are at increased risk for the development of melanoma. [23]\n\nHaving more than 50 moles indicates an increased risk of melanoma. A weakened immune system makes cancer development easier due to the body's weakened ability to fight cancer cells. [20]\n\n\n## UV radiation\n\nThe main risk factor for melanoma formation is exposure to UV radiation, either from sunlight or indoor tanning. UV radiation exposure from tanning beds increases the risk of melanoma. [24][25]  The International Agency for Research on Cancer finds that tanning beds are \"carcinogenic to humans\" and that people who begin using tanning devices before the age of thirty years are 75% more likely to develop melanoma.

Thymine,  cytosine,  or cytosine-thymine dimers are formed by the joining of two adjacent pyrimidine bases within a strand of DNA. UVA light presents at wavelengths longer than UVB (between 400 and 315 nm); and it can also be absorbed directly by DNA in skin cells, but at lower efficiencies-about 1/100 to 1/1000 of UVB. [28]\n\nRadiation exposure (UVA and UVB) is a major contributor to the development of melanoma. [29]  Occasional extreme sun exposure that results in \"sunburn\" on areas of the human body is causally related to melanoma. [30]  The risk appears to be strongly influenced by socioeconomic conditions rather than indoor versus outdoor occupations; it is more  common  in  professional  and  administrative  workers  than  in  unskilled  workers.

Melanocytes  are  found between the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis) and the next layer (the dermis). This early stage of the disease is called  the  radial  growth  phase,  when  the  tumor  is  less  than  1  mm  thick,  and  spreads  at  the  level  of  the  basal epidermis. [45]  Because the cancer cells have not yet reached the blood vessels deeper in the skin, it is very unlikely that this early-stage melanoma will spread to other parts of the body. If the melanoma is detected at this stage, then it can usually be completely removed with surgery.

[80]  People's moles tend to look like one another, but when there is a mole that looks different than someone's other moles, it is more likely to be a  melanoma. [11]   The  \"Little  Red  Riding  Hood\"  sign  suggests  that  individuals  with  fair  skin  and  light-colored  hair might have difficult-to-diagnose amelanotic melanomas. [80]  Extra care is required when examining such individuals, as they might have multiple melanomas and severely dysplastic nevi.\n\nAmelanotic  melanomas  (a  rare  subtype)  have  very  little  to  no  pigmentation  and  are  therefore  more  difficult  to detect. [11]  The acral subtype of melanoma presents in areas that do not usually get sun exposure and are difficult to see  by  a  person  (the  soles  of  the  feet,  and  palms  of  hand)  making  detection  difficult.  Thirty  to  40%  of  acral melanomas are amelanotic (producing little to no pigment), also making the diagnosis challenging. [11]",

A skin biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis of melanoma and staging the cancer. [11]  Elliptical excisional biopsies may remove the tumor, followed by histological analysis  and  Breslow  scoring.  Incisional  biopsies  such  as  punch  biopsies  are  usually  contraindicated  in  suspected melanomas,  because  of  the  possibility  of  sampling  error  or  local  implantation  causing  misestimation  of  tumour thickness.

Although  controversial, sentinel lymph node biopsies and examination of the lymph nodes are also performed in patients to assess spread to the lymph nodes; this test is very sensitive, with a high negative predictive value, meaning that if no metastatic disease is detected then patients can be assured that the chance of spread is very low. [96]  A diagnosis of melanoma is supported by the presence of the S100 protein marker.\n\nHMB-45 is a monoclonal antibody that reacts against an antigen present in melanocytic tumors such as melanomas. It is used in anatomic pathology as a marker for  such  tumors.  The  antibody  was  generated  against  an  extract  of melanoma.  It  reacts  positively  against  melanocytic  tumors  but  not  other tumors,  thus  demonstrating  specificity  and  sensitivity.  The  antibody  also reacts positively against junctional nevus cells but not intradermal nevi, and against fetal melanocytes but not normal adult melanocytes.",

[97]\n\n\n## Ultraviolet radiation\n\nMinimizing exposure to sources of ultraviolet radiation (the sun and sunbeds) and other sun protection measures such  as  wearing  sun  protective  clothing  (long-sleeved  shirts,  long  trousers,  and  broad-brimmed  hats)  can  offer protection. [98][11]  Using artificial light for tanning was once believed to help prevent skin cancers, but it can lead to an increased incidence of melanomas. [99]\n\nUV nail lamps, which are used in nail salons to dry nail polish, are another widespread source of UV radiation that could be avoided. [100][101]   Although  the  risk  of  developing  skin  cancer  through  UV  nail  lamp  use  is  low,  it  is  still recommended to wear fingerless gloves and/or apply SPF 30 or greater sunscreen to the hands before using a UV nail lamp.

Exposure to sunlight can be intermittent instead of all at one time. [102]\n\n\n## Sunscreen\n\nSunscreen appears to be effective in preventing melanoma. [2][12]  In the past, use of sunscreens with a sun protection factor  (SPF)  rating  of  50  or  higher  on  exposed  areas  were  recommended;  as  older  sunscreens  more  effectively blocked UVA with higher SPF. [103]  Currently, newer sunscreen ingredients (avobenzone, zinc oxide, and titanium dioxide)  effectively  block  both  UVA  and  UVB  even  at  lower  SPFs.  Sunscreen  also  protects  against  squamous  cell carcinoma, another skin cancer. [104]\n\nConcerns have been raised that sunscreen might create a false sense of security against sun damage. [105]",

[106]  A 2006 review however did not support any benefit. [107]\n\n\n## Treatment\n\nConfirmation  of  the  clinical  diagnosis  is  done  with  a  skin  biopsy.  This  is usually followed up with a wider excision of the scar or tumor. Depending on the  stage,  a  sentinel  lymph  node  biopsy  may  be  performed.  Controversy exists around benefit for sentinel lymph node biopsy; with unclear evidence of benefit as of 2015. [108][109]\n\n\n## Surgery\n\nExcisional  biopsies  may  remove  the  tumor,  but  further  surgery  is  often necessary to make sure all of the tumor is removed and reduce the risk of recurrence.  Complete  surgical  excision  with  adequate  surgical  margins  is standard. Often this is done by a wide local excision (WLE) with 5 mm to 2 cm  margins.  Melanoma-in-situ  and  lentigo malignas are treated  with narrower surgical margins, usually 0.2 to 5 cm. A wide-local excision usually",

[11]   Mohs  surgery,  or  the  double-bladed  technique  with margin control is sometimes used. The sample is inspected histologically to make sure no tumor cells involve the cut margins, indicating an inadequate tumor of removal.

This is due to the ill-defined visible surgical margin and the facial location of the lesions (often forcing the surgeon to use a narrow surgical margin). The narrow surgical margin used, combined with the limitation of the standard \"bread-loafing\" technique of fixed tissue histology, results in a high \"false negative\" error rate and frequent recurrences. Margin control (peripheral margins) is necessary to eliminate the false-negative errors. If bread loafing is  used,  distances  from  sections  should  approach 0.1 mm to assure that the method approaches complete margin control.

However,  one example lies in a 1960s examination of nine Peruvian mummies, radiocarbon dated to be approximately 2400 years old,  which  showed  apparent  signs  of  melanoma:  melanotic  masses  in  the  skin  and  diffuse  metastases  to  the bones. [162]\n\nJohn Hunter is reported to be the first to operate on metastatic melanoma in 1787. Although not knowing precisely what it was, he described it as a \"cancerous fungous excrescence\". The excised tumor was preserved in the Hunterian Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. It was not until 1968 that microscopic examination of the specimen revealed it to be an example of metastatic melanoma. [163]\n\nThe French physician René Laennec was the first to describe melanoma as a disease entity. His report was initially presented during a lecture for the Faculté de Médecine de Paris in 1804 and then published as a bulletin in 1806. [164]",

[165]   In  his  later  work  in  1857  he  remarked  that  there  is  a  familial  predisposition  for development  of  melanoma  ( Eight  Cases  of  Melanosis  with  Pathological  and  Therapeutical  Remarks  on  That Disease ).  Norris  was  also  a  pioneer  in  suggesting  a  link  between  nevi  and  melanoma  and  the  possibility  of  a relationship  between  melanoma  and  environmental  exposures,  by  observing  that  most  of  his  patients  had  pale complexions. [166]  He also described that melanomas could be amelanotic and later showed the metastatic nature of melanoma by observing that they can disseminate to other visceral organs.\n\nThe  first  formal  acknowledgment  of  advanced  melanoma  as  untreatable  came  from  Samuel  Cooper  in  1840.  He stated  that  the  only  chance  for  a  cure  depends  upon  the  early  removal  of  the  disease  (i.e.,  early  excision  of  the malignant mole) ...' [167]",

The word melanoma has a long history of being used in  a  broader  sense  to  refer  to  any  melanocytic  tumor,  typically,  but  not  always  malignant, [170][171]   but  today  the narrower sense referring only to malignant types has become so dominant that benign tumors are usually not called melanomas anymore and the word melanoma is now usually taken to mean malignant melanoma unless otherwise specified. Terms  such  as \"benign melanocytic tumor\"  unequivocally label the  benign  types,  and  modern histopathologic tumor classifications used in medicine do not use the word for benign tumors.\n\n\n## Research",

[130]   These  cells  are  grown  in  large  numbers  in  a  laboratory  and returned to the patient after a treatment that temporarily reduces normal T cells in the patient's body. TIL therapy following lymphodepletion can result in durable complete response in a variety of setups.

The rationale behind this lies in their potential to inhibit human endogenous retroviruses, whose activity has been associated with the development of melanoma.

        "text": "# Melanoma\n\nMelanoma is  a  type  of  skin  cancer;  it  develops  from  the  melaninproducing cells known as melanocytes. [1]  It typically occurs in the skin, but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines, or eye (uveal melanoma). [1][2]  In very rare cases melanoma can also happen in the lung,  which  is  known  as  primary  pulmonary  melanoma  and  only happens in 0.01% of primary lung tumors. [7]\n\nIn  women,  melanomas  most  commonly  occur  on  the  legs;  while  in men, on the back. [2]  Melanoma is frequently referred to as malignant melanoma .  However,  the  medical  community  stresses  that  there  is no such thing as a 'benign melanoma' and recommends that the term 'malignant melanoma' should be avoided as redundant. [8][9][10]\n\nAbout 30% of melanomas develop from moles. [11]  Changes in a mole that can indicate melanoma include increase-especially rapid increase -in size, irregular edges, change in color, itchiness, or skin breakdown. [1]\n\nThe primary cause of melanoma is ultraviolet light (UV) exposure in those with low levels of the skin pigment melanin. [2][12]  The UV light may  be  from  the  sun  or  other  sources,  such  as  tanning  devices. [2] Those  with  many  moles,  a  history  of  affected  family  members,  and poor immune function are at greater risk. [1]  A number of rare genetic conditions, such as xeroderma pigmentosum, also increase the risk. [13] Diagnosis is by biopsy and analysis of any skin lesion that has signs of being potentially cancerous. [1]\n\nAvoiding  UV  light  and  using  sunscreen  in  UV-bright  sun  conditions may prevent melanoma. [2]  Treatment typically is removal by surgery of the  melanoma  and  the  potentially  affected  adjacent  tissue  bordering the  melanoma. [1]   In  those  with  slightly  larger  cancers,  nearby  lymph nodes may be tested for spread (metastasis). [1]  Most people are cured if metastasis  has  not  occurred. [1]   For  those  in  whom  melanoma  has spread, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy  may  improve  survival. [1][14]   With  treatment,  the  fiveyear  survival  rates  in  the  United  States  are  99%  among  those  with localized  disease,  65%  when  the  disease  has  spread  to  lymph  nodes, and  25%  among  those  with  distant  spread.

[5][6]  The incidence of melanoma is expected to increase from 331,722 worldwide cases in 2022 to 510,000 cases in 2040. [11]  However mortality is decreasing as newer treatments become available. [11]  About 80% of all global cases occur in adults 50 years or older. [11]  Australia and New Zealand have the highest rates of melanoma in the world. [2]  High rates also occur in Northern Europe and North America, while it is less common in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. [2]  In the United States, melanoma occurs about 1.6 times more often in men than women. [15] Melanoma  has  become  more  common  since  the  1960s  in  areas  mostly  populated  by  people  of  European descent. [2][13]"

        "text": "# Signs and symptoms\n\nEarly signs of melanoma are changes to the shape or color of existing moles or, in the case of nodular melanoma, the appearance of a new lump anywhere on the skin. At later stages, the mole may itch, ulcerate, or bleed. Early signs of melanoma are summarized by the mnemonic \"ABCDEEFG\": [16][17]\n\n\n- A symmetry\n- B orders (irregular with edges and corners)\n- C olour (variegated)\n- D iameter (greater than 6 mm (0.24 in), about the size of a pencil eraser)\n- E volving over time\n\n\nThis classification does not apply to nodular melanoma, which has its own classifications: [18]\n\n\n- E levated above the skin surface\n- F irm to the touch\n- G rowing\n\n\nMetastatic melanoma may cause nonspecific paraneoplastic symptoms, including loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and  fatigue.  Brain  metastases  are  particularly  common  in  patients  with  metastatic  melanoma. [19]   Other  common sites of metastasis of melanoma include liver, intestines, bone, lungs and distant lymph nodes. [11]\n\n\n## Cause\n\nMelanomas are typically caused by DNA damage resulting from exposure to UV light from the sun. Genetics also play a  role. [20][21]   Melanoma  can  also  occur  in  skin  areas  with  little  sun  exposure  (i.e.,  mouth,  soles  of  feet,  palms  of hands,  genital  areas). [22]   People  with  dysplastic  nevus  syndrome,  also  known  as  familial  atypical  multiple  mole melanoma, are at increased risk for the development of melanoma. [23]\n\nHaving more than 50 moles indicates an increased risk of melanoma. A weakened immune system makes cancer development easier due to the body's weakened ability to fight cancer cells. [20]\n\n\n## UV radiation\n\nThe main risk factor for melanoma formation is exposure to UV radiation, either from sunlight or indoor tanning. UV radiation exposure from tanning beds increases the risk of melanoma. [24][25]  The International Agency for Research on Cancer finds that tanning beds are \"carcinogenic to humans\" and that people who begin using tanning devices before the age of thirty years are 75% more likely to develop melanoma. [26]\n\nThose who work in airplanes also appear to have an increased risk, believed to be due to greater exposure to UV. [27]\n\nUVB light, emanating from the sun at wavelengths between 315 and 280 nm, is absorbed directly by DNA in skin cells,  which  results  in  a  type  of  direct  DNA  damage  called  cyclobutane  pyrimidine  dimers.  Thymine,  cytosine,  or cytosine-thymine dimers are formed by the joining of two adjacent pyrimidine bases within a strand of DNA. UVA light presents at wavelengths longer than UVB (between 400 and 315 nm); and it can also be absorbed directly by DNA in skin cells, but at lower efficiencies-about 1/100 to 1/1000 of UVB. [28]\n\nRadiation exposure (UVA and UVB) is a major contributor to the development of melanoma. [29]  Occasional extreme sun exposure that results in \"sunburn\" on areas of the human body is causally related to melanoma. [30]  The risk appears to be strongly influenced by socioeconomic conditions rather than indoor versus outdoor occupations; it is more  common  in  professional  and  administrative  workers  than  in  unskilled  workers. [31][32]   Other  factors  are mutations in (or total loss of) tumor suppressor genes.\n\nPossible significant elements in determining risk include the intensity and duration of sun exposure, the age at which sun exposure occurs, and the degree of skin pigmentation. Melanoma rates tend to be highest in countries settled by migrants from Europe, which have a large amount of direct, intense sunlight to which the skin of the settlers is not adapted,  most  notably  Australia.  Exposure  during  childhood  is  a  more  important  risk  factor  than  exposure  in adulthood. This is seen in migration studies in Australia. [33]"

        "text": "Incurring  multiple  severe  sunburns  increases  the  likelihood  that  future  sunburns  develop  into  melanoma  due  to cumulative damage. Living close to the equator increases exposure to UV radiation. [20]\n\n\n# Genetics\n\nIt is believed that 5-12% of melanoma is hereditary. [11][34]  Having a family history of melanoma increases one's risk, with having a first-degree relative increasing one's risk of developing melanoma by 1.74 times. Having a personal history of melanoma increases the risk of developing another melanoma in the future, by some estimates an 8.40 times  increased  risk. [35][11][20]   Familial  melanoma  is  more  likely  to  present  at  an  earlier  age  and  more  likely  to present as multiple skin lesions than non-familial melanoma. [34]  Familial melanoma is also more likely to present as thinner lesions (less depth of skin invasion. [34]\n\nA number of rare mutations, which often run in families, greatly increase melanoma susceptibility. [36]  Several genes increase risks. Some rare genes have a relatively high risk of causing melanoma; some more common genes, such as a gene  called MC1R that  causes  red  hair,  have  an  elevated  risk.  Genetic  testing  can  be  used  to  search  for  the mutations. [37]   Melanoma  with  genetic  mutations  in  the  BRAF  genes  V600E  or  V600K  (proteins  involved  in  cell growth) are more responsive to therapy with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib plus trametinib. [11]\n\nOne class of mutations affects the gene CDKN2A .  An  alternative reading frame mutation in this gene leads to the destabilization of p53, a transcription factor involved in apoptosis and in 50% of human cancers. Another mutation in the same gene results in a nonfunctional inhibitor of CDK4, a cyclin-dependent kinase that promotes cell division. Mutations  that  cause  the  skin  condition  xeroderma  pigmentosum  (XP)  also  increase  melanoma  susceptibility. Scattered  throughout  the  genome,  these  mutations  reduce  a  cell's  ability  to  repair  DNA.  Both  CDKN2A  and  XP mutations are highly penetrant (the chances of a carrier expressing the phenotype are high).\n\nFamilial melanoma is genetically heterogeneous, [21]  and loci for familial melanoma appear on the chromosome arms 1p, 9p and 12q. Multiple genetic events have been related to melanoma's pathogenesis (disease development). [38]  The multiple tumor suppressor 1 (CDKN2A/MTS1) gene encodes p16INK4a - a low-molecular weight protein inhibitor of cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs) - which has been localised to the p21 region of human chromosome 9. [39]\n\nDysplastic  nevus  syndrome  also  known  as  FAMMM  (familial  atypical  multiple  mole-melanoma)  is  typically characterized by having 50 or more combined moles in addition to a family history of melanoma. [22]  It is transmitted autosomal dominantly and mostly associated with the CDKN2A mutations. [22]  People who have a CDKN2A mutation associated with FAMMM have a 38-fold increased risk of pancreatic cancer. [40]  People with FAMMM also have a 30% lifetime risk of developing melanoma. [11]\n\nPeople with mutations in the MC1R gene are two to 2.7-3.6 times more likely to develop melanoma than those with two  wild-type  (typical  unaffected  type)  copies.  Some  MC1R  gene  variants  are  more  common  in  those  with  red hair. [41][42]  Mutation of the MDM2 SNP309 gene is associated with increased risks for younger women. [43]\n\nFair  and  red-haired  people,  persons  with  multiple  atypical  nevi  or  dysplastic  nevi,  and  persons  born  with  giant congenital melanocytic nevi are at increased risk. [44]  Fair skin is the result of having less melanin in the skin, which means less protection from UV radiation exists. [20]\n\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nThe  earliest  stage  of  melanoma  starts  when  melanocytes  begin  out-of-control  growth.  Melanocytes  are  found between the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis) and the next layer (the dermis). This early stage of the disease is called  the  radial  growth  phase,  when  the  tumor  is  less  than  1  mm  thick,  and  spreads  at  the  level  of  the  basal epidermis. [45]  Because the cancer cells have not yet reached the blood vessels deeper in the skin, it is very unlikely that this early-stage melanoma will spread to other parts of the body. If the melanoma is detected at this stage, then it can usually be completely removed with surgery. [46]\n\nWhen the tumor cells start to move in a different direction - vertically up into the epidermis and into the papillary dermis - cell behaviour changes dramatically. [47]"

The  tumor becomes able to grow into the surrounding tissue and can spread around the body through blood or lymph vessels. The tumor thickness is usually more than 1 mm (0.04 in), and the tumor involves the deeper parts of the dermis.\n\nThe  host  elicits  an  immunological  reaction  against  the  tumor  during  the VGP, [48]  which is judged by the presence and activity of the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).  These  cells  sometimes  completely  destroy  the  primary tumor; this is called regression, which is the latest stage of development. In certain  cases,  the  primary  tumor  is  completely  destroyed  and  only  the metastatic  tumor  is  discovered.  About  40%  of  human  melanomas  contain activating mutations affecting the structure of the B-Raf protein, resulting in constitutive signaling through the Raf to MAP kinase pathway. [49]\n\nA cause common to most cancers is damage to DNA. [50]  UVA light mainly causes  thymine  dimers. [51]   UVA  also  produces  reactive  oxygen  species  and these  inflict  other  DNA  damage,  primarily  single-strand  breaks,  oxidized pyrimidines  and  the  oxidized  purine  8-oxoguanine  (a  mutagenic  DNA change)  at  1/10,  1/10,  and  1/3rd  the  frequencies  of  UVA-induced  thymine dimers, respectively.\n\nIf  unrepaired, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) photoproducts can lead to mutations by inaccurate translesion synthesis during DNA replication or repair. The most frequent mutations due to inaccurate synthesis past CPDs are  cytosine  to  thymine  (C>T)  or  CC>TT  transition  mutations.  These  are commonly  referred  to  as  UV  fingerprint  mutations,  as  they  are  the  most specific mutation caused by UV, being frequently found in sun-exposed skin, but rarely found  in  internal organs. [52]   Errors  in  DNA  repair  of  UV photoproducts,  or  inaccurate  synthesis  past  these  photoproducts,  can  also lead to deletions, insertions, and chromosomal translocations.\n\nThe entire genomes of 25 melanomas were sequenced. [53]  On average, about\n\n80,000 mutated bases (mostly C>T transitions) and about 100 structural rearrangements were found per melanoma genome. This is much higher than the roughly 70 mutations across generations (parent to child). [54][55]  Among the 25 melanomas,  about  6,000  protein-coding  genes  had  missense,  nonsense,  or  splice  site  mutations.  The transcriptomes of over 100 melanomas has also been sequenced and analyzed. Almost 70% of all human proteincoding genes are expressed in melanoma. Most of these genes are also expressed in other normal and cancer tissues, with some 200 genes showing a more specific expression pattern in melanoma compared to other forms of cancer. Examples of melanoma specific genes are tyrosinase, MLANA, and PMEL . [56][57]\n\nUV radiation causes damage to the DNA of cells, typically thymine dimerization, which, when unrepaired, can create mutations  in  the  cell's  genes.  This  strong  mutagenic  factor  makes  cutaneous  melanoma  the  tumor  type  with  the highest number of mutations. [58]  When the cell divides, these mutations are propagated to new generations of cells. If the mutations occur in protooncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, the rate of mitosis in the mutation-bearing cells can become uncontrolled, leading to the formation of a tumor. Data from patients suggest that aberrant levels of activating transcription factor in the nucleus of melanoma cells are associated with increased metastatic activity of melanoma cells; [59][60][61]  studies from mice on skin cancer tend to confirm a role for activating transcription factor2 in cancer progression. [62][63]\n\nCancer stem cells may also be involved. [64]"

        "text": "# Gene mutations\n\nLarge-scale studies, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas, have characterized recurrent somatic alterations likely driving initiation and development of cutaneous melanoma. The Cancer Genome Atlas study has established four subtypes: BRAF mutant, RAS mutant, NF1 mutant, and triple wild-type. [65]\n\nThe most frequent mutation occurs in the 600th codon of BRAF (50% of cases). BRAF is  normally involved in cell growth, and this specific mutation renders the protein constitutively active and independent of normal physiological regulation, thus fostering tumor growth. [66]  RAS genes (NRAS, HRAS and KRAS) are also recurrently mutated (30% of TCGA cases) and mutations in the 61st or 12th codons trigger oncogenic activity. Loss-of-function mutations often affect  tumor  suppressor  genes  such  as  NF1,  TP53  and  CDKN2A.  Other  oncogenic  alterations  include  fusions involving various kinases such as BRAF, [67]  RAF1, [68]  ALK, RET, ROS1, NTRK1., [69]  NTRK3 [70]  and MET [71] BRAF, RAS , and NF1 mutations and kinase fusions are remarkably mutually exclusive, as they occur in different subsets of patients. Assessment of mutation status can, therefore, improve patient stratification and inform targeted therapy with specific inhibitors.\n\nIn some cases (3-7%), mutated versions of BRAF and NRAS undergo copy-number amplification. [65]\n\n\n## Metastasis\n\nThe research done by Sarna's team proved that heavily pigmented melanoma cells have Young's modulus about 4.93, while in non-pigmented ones it was only 0.98. [72]  In another experiment they found that elasticity of melanoma cells is  important  for  its  metastasis  and  growth:  non-pigmented  tumors  were  bigger  than  pigmented  and  it  was  much easier for them to spread. They showed that there are both pigmented and non-pigmented cells in melanoma tumors, so that they can both be drug-resistant and metastatic. [72]\n\n\n## Diagnosis\n\nVisually inspecting the skin lesion in question is the first step in diagnosing a suspected a melanoma. [73]  Moles that are irregular in color or shape are suspicious for  melanoma.  To  detect melanomas,  it  is  recommended  to  learn  to  recognize  them  (see \"ABCDE\"  mnemonic),  to  regularly  examine  moles  for  changes (shape, size, color, itching or bleeding) and to consult a qualified physician when a suspicious skin lesion appears. [74][75]  In-person inspection of suspicious skin lesions is more accurate than visual inspection of images. [76]\n\nWhen used by trained specialists, dermoscopy is more helpful to identify  malignant  lesions  than  use  of  the  naked  eye  alone. [77] Reflectance confocal microscopy may have better sensitivity and specificity  than  dermoscopy  in  diagnosing  cutaneous  melanoma but more studies are needed to confirm this result. [78]\n\nMany  melanomas  present  as  lesions  smaller  than  6  mm  in diameter. Physicians typically examine all moles, including those less than 6 mm in diameter. Seborrheic keratosis may meet some or  all  of  the  ABCD  criteria  and  may  be  sometimes  mistaken  for melanoma. Doctors can generally distinguish seborrheic keratosis from melanoma upon examination or with dermatoscopy. [79]\n\nTotal body photography, which involves photographic documentation of as much body surface as possible, is sometimes used to objectively observe the evolution of body moles over time, to potentially find moles that become suspicious. It is often used during  follow-up  for  high-risk  patients.  The  technique  has  been"

[80]  People's moles tend to look like one another, but when there is a mole that looks different than someone's other moles, it is more likely to be a  melanoma. [11]   The  \"Little  Red  Riding  Hood\"  sign  suggests  that  individuals  with  fair  skin  and  light-colored  hair might have difficult-to-diagnose amelanotic melanomas. [80]  Extra care is required when examining such individuals, as they might have multiple melanomas and severely dysplastic nevi.\n\nAmelanotic  melanomas  (a  rare  subtype)  have  very  little  to  no  pigmentation  and  are  therefore  more  difficult  to detect. [11]  The acral subtype of melanoma presents in areas that do not usually get sun exposure and are difficult to see  by  a  person  (the  soles  of  the  feet,  and  palms  of  hand)  making  detection  difficult.

        "text": "# Biopsy\n\nFollowing a visual examination and a dermatoscopic exam, or other specialized tests such as confocal microscopy, a skin biopsy is done for lesions suspicious of being melanoma. A skin biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis of melanoma and staging the cancer. [11]  Elliptical excisional biopsies may remove the tumor, followed by histological analysis  and  Breslow  scoring.  Incisional  biopsies  such  as  punch  biopsies  are  usually  contraindicated  in  suspected melanomas,  because  of  the  possibility  of  sampling  error  or  local  implantation  causing  misestimation  of  tumour thickness. [81][82][83] However,  fears that such biopsies may  increase the risk of metastatic disease  seem unfounded. [84][85]\n\n\n## Histopathologic types\n\nMelanoma is a type of neuroectodermal neoplasm.

        "text": "# In situ or invasive\n\nA  melanoma in  situ has  not  invaded  beyond  the  basement  membrane, whereas an invasive melanoma has spread beyond it.\n\nSome histopathological types of melanoma are inherently invasive, including nodular  melanoma  and  lentigo  maligna  melanoma,  where  the in situ counterpart  to  lentigo  maligna  melanoma  is  lentigo  maligna. [90]   Lentigo maligna is sometimes classified as a very early melanoma, [91]  and sometimes a precursor to melanoma. [92]\n\nSuperficial  spreading  melanomas  and  acral  lentiginous  melanomas  can  be either in situ or invasive, [93]  but acral lentiginous melanomas are almost always invasive. [94]\n\n\n## Staging\n\nFurther context on cancer staging is available at TNM.\n\nMelanomas  are  staged  based  on  the  depth  of  invasion  in various layers of the skin, the presence of ulceration, spread to local lymph nodes or spread to distant lymph nodes and organs (metastasis). [11]\n\nMetastatic melanomas can be detected by CT scans, MRIs, and PET/CTs,  or  ultrasound.  PET/CT  to  assess  for  metastasis  is generally  recommended  for  people  with  stage  IIB  or  greater melanoma. [11]   If  a  person  has  an  ulcerated  lesion,  or  if  the depth  of  tumor  invasion  is  greater  than  0.8  mm,  then  a sentinel  lymph  node  biopsy  is  recommended. [11]   LDH  levels may sometimes be elevated in metastatic melanoma, but this is not required for the diagnosis nor staging.

        "text": "Older systems include \"Clark level\" and \"Breslow's depth\", quantifying microscopic depth of tumor invasion.\n\n\n# Laboratory\n\nIt  is  common  for  patients  diagnosed  with  melanoma  to  have  chest  X-rays, and  in  some  cases  CT,  MRI,  and/or  PET  scans.  Although  controversial, sentinel lymph node biopsies and examination of the lymph nodes are also performed in patients to assess spread to the lymph nodes; this test is very sensitive, with a high negative predictive value, meaning that if no metastatic disease is detected then patients can be assured that the chance of spread is very low. [96]  A diagnosis of melanoma is supported by the presence of the S100 protein marker.\n\nHMB-45 is a monoclonal antibody that reacts against an antigen present in melanocytic tumors such as melanomas. It is used in anatomic pathology as a marker for  such  tumors.  The  antibody  was  generated  against  an  extract  of melanoma.  It  reacts  positively  against  melanocytic  tumors  but  not  other tumors,  thus  demonstrating  specificity  and  sensitivity.  The  antibody  also reacts positively against junctional nevus cells but not intradermal nevi, and against fetal melanocytes but not normal adult melanocytes.\n\nHMB-45 is nonreactive with almost all non-melanoma human malignancies, except rare tumors showing evidence of melanogenesis  (e.g.,  pigmented  schwannoma,  clear  cell  sarcoma)  or  tumors  associated  with  tuberous  sclerosis complex (angiomyolipoma and lymphangiomyoma).\n\n\n## Prevention\n\nThere is no evidence to support or refute adult population screening for melanoma. [97]\n\n\n## Ultraviolet radiation\n\nMinimizing exposure to sources of ultraviolet radiation (the sun and sunbeds) and other sun protection measures such  as  wearing  sun  protective  clothing  (long-sleeved  shirts,  long  trousers,  and  broad-brimmed  hats)  can  offer protection. [98][11]  Using artificial light for tanning was once believed to help prevent skin cancers, but it can lead to an increased incidence of melanomas. [99]\n\nUV nail lamps, which are used in nail salons to dry nail polish, are another widespread source of UV radiation that could be avoided. [100][101]   Although  the  risk  of  developing  skin  cancer  through  UV  nail  lamp  use  is  low,  it  is  still recommended to wear fingerless gloves and/or apply SPF 30 or greater sunscreen to the hands before using a UV nail lamp. [100][101]\n\nThe body uses UV light to generate vitamin D so there is a need to balance getting enough sunlight to maintain healthy vitamin D levels and reducing the risk of melanoma; it takes around a half-hour of sunlight for the body to generate its vitamin D for the day and this is about the same amount of time it takes for fair-skinned people to get a sunburn. Exposure to sunlight can be intermittent instead of all at one time. [102]\n\n\n## Sunscreen\n\nSunscreen appears to be effective in preventing melanoma. [2][12]  In the past, use of sunscreens with a sun protection factor  (SPF)  rating  of  50  or  higher  on  exposed  areas  were  recommended;  as  older  sunscreens  more  effectively blocked UVA with higher SPF. [103]  Currently, newer sunscreen ingredients (avobenzone, zinc oxide, and titanium dioxide)  effectively  block  both  UVA  and  UVB  even  at  lower  SPFs.  Sunscreen  also  protects  against  squamous  cell carcinoma, another skin cancer. [104]\n\nConcerns have been raised that sunscreen might create a false sense of security against sun damage. [105]"

        "text": "# Medications\n\nA 2005 review found tentative evidence that statin and fibrate medication may decrease the risk of melanoma. [106]  A 2006 review however did not support any benefit. [107]\n\n\n## Treatment\n\nConfirmation  of  the  clinical  diagnosis  is  done  with  a  skin  biopsy.  This  is usually followed up with a wider excision of the scar or tumor. Depending on the  stage,  a  sentinel  lymph  node  biopsy  may  be  performed.  Controversy exists around benefit for sentinel lymph node biopsy; with unclear evidence of benefit as of 2015. [108][109]\n\n\n## Surgery\n\nExcisional  biopsies  may  remove  the  tumor,  but  further  surgery  is  often necessary to make sure all of the tumor is removed and reduce the risk of recurrence.  Complete  surgical  excision  with  adequate  surgical  margins  is standard. Often this is done by a wide local excision (WLE) with 5 mm to 2 cm  margins.  Melanoma-in-situ  and  lentigo malignas are treated  with narrower surgical margins, usually 0.2 to 5 cm. A wide-local excision usually\n\nremoves 5 mm to 2 cm around the tumor, with the margins determined by the Breslow Depth (2 cm margins are removed for  a  Breslow  tumor  Depth  greater  than  2  mm). [11]   Mohs  surgery,  or  the  double-bladed  technique  with margin control is sometimes used. The sample is inspected histologically to make sure no tumor cells involve the cut margins, indicating an inadequate tumor of removal. The wide excision aims to reduce the rate of tumor recurrence at the site of the original lesion. A 2009 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found a small difference in survival  rates  favoring  wide  excision  of  primary  cutaneous  melanomas,  but  these  results  were  not  statistically significant. [110]\n\nMohs surgery has been reported with cure rate as low as 77% and as high as 98.0% for melanoma-in-situ. [111][112] CCPDMA and the \"double scalpel\" peripheral margin controlled surgery is equivalent to Mohs surgery in removal of melanoma in-situ.\n\nMelanomas  that  spread  usually  do  so  to  the  lymph  nodes  in  the  area  of  the  tumor  before  spreading  elsewhere. Attempts  to  improve  survival  by  removing  lymph  nodes  surgically  (lymph  node  dissection)  were  associated  with many complications, but no overall survival benefit. [11]\n\nSentinel  lymph  node  biopsy  may  indicate  if  cancer  has  spread  to  local  lymph  nodes  and  guide  treatment decisions. [113][114][115]\n\nNeither sentinel lymph node biopsy nor other diagnostic tests should be performed to evaluate early, thin melanoma, including  melanoma  in  situ,  T1a  melanoma,  or  T1b  melanoma  ≤  0.5mm. [116]   People  with  these  conditions  are unlikely to have the cancer spread to their lymph nodes or anywhere else and have a 5-year survival rate of 97%. [116]\n\nSentinel  lymph  node  biopsy  is  indicated  for  ulcerated  melanomas  or  melanomas  of  greater  than  0.8  mm thickness. [11]  A process called lymphoscintigraphy is performed in which a radioactive tracer is injected at the tumor site to localize the sentinel node. Further precision is provided using a blue tracer dye, and surgery is performed to biopsy the node. Routine hematoxylin and eosin and immunoperoxidase staining will be adequate to rule out node involvement.\n\nIf a lymph node is positive, depending on the extent of lymph node spread, a radical lymph node dissection may be performed in which affected lymph nodes are surgically removed. Lymph node dissection is not assocated with a survival benefit in those with melanoma and is no longer recommended. [11]\n\n\n## Add on treatment\n\nAdjuvant treatment after surgery may reduce the risk of recurrence, especially in high-risk melanomas. The most common adjuvant treatment is immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment for up to a year post-surgery. [117]"

        "text": "In the early 2000s, a relatively common strategy was to treat patients with a high risk of recurrence with up to a year of  high-dose  interferon  treatment. [118]   A  2013  meta-analysis  suggested  that  the  addition  of  interferon  alpha increased disease-free and overall survival for people with AJCC TNM stage II-III cutaneous melanoma. [119]  A 2011 meta-analysis showed that interferon could lengthen the time before a melanoma comes back but increased survival by only 3% at 5 years. The unpleasant side effects also greatly decrease the quality of life. [120]  Interferon is no longer routinely used in the treatment of melanoma outside of clinical trials. [121][122]\n\n\n# Chemotherapy\n\nChemotherapy  drugs  such  as  dacarbazine  have  been  commonly  used  for  metastatic  melanoma  since  the  1970s; however, their efficacy  in  terms  of  survival  has  never  been  proven  in  an  RCT. [123]   Since  the  approval  of  immune checkpoint inhibitors, dacarbazine and its oral counterpart, temozolomide, constitute potential treatment options in later lines of therapy. [124]\n\nMultiple drugs are available to patients to decrease the size of the tumor. By lessening the size of the tumor, some symptoms can be relieved; however, this does not necessarily lead to remission. Some of these drugs are dacarbazine, temozolomide, and fotemustine. Combinations of drugs are also used and, in some cases, present higher remission rates. Although combinations of drugs increase remission rates, the survival rate does not show an increase. [125]\n\nIn people with locally advanced cutaneous malignancies and sarcoma, isolated limb infusion (ILI) has been found to be a minimally invasive and well-tolerated procedure for delivering regional chemotherapy. [126][127]\n\n\n## Targeted therapy\n\nMelanoma cells have mutations that allow them to survive and grow indefinitely in the body. [123]  Small-molecule targeted therapies work by blocking the genes involved in pathways for tumor proliferation and survival. [123]  The main  treatments  are  BRAF,  C-Kit  and  NRAS  inhibitors. [128]   These  inhibitors  work  to  inhibit  the  downstream pathways involved in cell proliferation and tumour development due to specific gene mutations. [129]  People can be treated with small-molecule targeted inhibitors if they are positive for the specific mutation. [123]  BRAF inhibitors, such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib and a MEK inhibitor trametinib are the most effective, approved treatments for BRAF positive melanoma. [130][123]  Melanoma tumors can develop resistance during therapy which can make therapy no longer effective,  but  combining  the  use  of  BRAF  and  MEK  inhibitors  may  create  a  fast  and  lasting  melanoma therapy response. [131]\n\nSeveral  treatments  improve  survival  over  traditional  chemotherapy. [123]   Biochemotherapy  (chemotherapy  with cytokines  IL-2  and  IFN-α)  combined  with  BRAF  inhibitors  improved  survival  for  people  with  BRAF-positive melanoma. [123] Biochemotherapy alone did not improve overall survival and had higher toxicity than chemotherapy. [123]   Combining  multiple  chemotherapy  agents  (polychemotherapy)  did  not  improve  survival  over monochemotherapy. [123]   Targeted  therapies  result  in  relatively  short  progression-free  survival  (PFS)  times.  The therapy combination of dabrafenib and trametinib has a 3-year PFS of 23% and a 5-year PFS of 13%. [132]\n\nLifileucel (Amtagvi) is a tumor-derived autologous T-cell immunotherapy that was approved for medical use in the United States in February 2024. [133][134]\n\n\n## Immunotherapy\n\nImmunotherapy is aimed at stimulating the person's immune system against the tumor to enhance the body's ability to  recognize  and  kill  cancer  cells. [135]   The  current  approach  to  treating  melanoma  with  immunotherapy  includes three  broad  categories  of  treatments,  including  cytokines,  immune  checkpoint  inhibitors,  and  adoptive  cell transfer. [135]   These  treatment  options  are  most  often  used  in  people  with  metastatic  melanoma  and  significantly improve overall survival. [123]\n\nCytokine  therapies  used  for  melanoma  include  IFN-a  and  IL-2. [136]   IL-2  (Proleukin)  was  the  first  new  therapy approved  (1990  EU,  1992  US)  for  the  treatment  of  metastatic  melanoma  in  20  years. [137]   IL-2  may  offer  the possibility  of  a  complete  and  long-lasting  remission  in  this  disease  in  a  small  percentage  of  people  with melanoma. [138]   Intralesional  IL-2  for  in-transit  metastases  has  a  high  complete  response  rate  ranging  from  40  to 100%. [130]  Similarly, IFN-α has shown only modest survival benefits and high toxicity, limiting its use as a standalone therapy. [123][136]"

        "text": "Immune check point inhibitors include anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies (ipilimumab and tremelimumab), tolllike  receptor  (TLR)  agonists,  CD40  agonists,  anti-PD-1  (pembrolizumab,  pidilizumab,  and  nivolumab)  and  PD-L1 antibodies. [135][136]  Evidence suggests that anti-PD-1 antibodies are more effective than anti-CTLA4 antibodies with less  systemic  toxicity. [123]   The  five-year  progression-free  survival  for  immunotherapy  with  pembrolizumab  is 21%. [132]   Nivolumab  or  pembrolizumab  was  associated  with  increased  recurrence  free  survival  at  12  months  of treatment. These medications block PD-1 to inhibit T-cell inactivation, this leads to more T-cell proliferation and activity  against  melanoma  cells. [11]   Either  medication  is  indicated  in  Stage  IIB-C  disease  (or  observation  after resection without using medication is also a treatment option). [11]\n\nFor  stage  IIIA-D  disease,  resection  of  tumor  may  be  followed  by  12  months  of  treatment  with  nivolumab  or pembrolizumab  or  dabrafenib  (BRAF  inhibitor)  plus  trametinib  (MEK  inhibitor)in  BRAF  gene  positive  disease. Observation after resection (without using immunotherapy) is also an option, but immunotherapy after resection is associated with an improved cancer-free survival rate at 5 years. [11]\n\nIn  those  with  stage  III  or  IV  disease  that  cannot  be  surgically  removed,  dual  checkpoint  blockade  by  combining nivolumab and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4 inhibitor) followed by maintenance nivolumab is associated with increased survival and has a lower mortality than using either agent alone. [11]\n\nA  therapeutic  approach  that  includes  the  combination  of  different  therapies  improves  overall  survival  and progression-free  survival  compared  to  treatment  with  the  separate  immunotherapy  drugs  alone. [123]   However, combination therapy also has a higher risk of immune-related adverse reactions (due to hyperactivity of the immune system). [11]\n\nOngoing research is looking at treatment by adoptive cell transfer. [139]  Adoptive cell transfer refers to the application of  pre-stimulated,  modified  T  cells  or  dendritic  cells  and  is  presently  used  to  minimize  complications  from  graftversus-host disease. [136][140]\n\nThe  combination  nivolumab/relatlimab  (Opdualag)  was  approved  for  medical  use  in  the  United  States  in  March 2022. [141]\n\n\n## Lentigo maligna\n\nStandard excision is still being done by most surgeons. Unfortunately, the recurrence rate is exceedingly high (up to 50%). This is due to the ill-defined visible surgical margin and the facial location of the lesions (often forcing the surgeon to use a narrow surgical margin). The narrow surgical margin used, combined with the limitation of the standard \"bread-loafing\" technique of fixed tissue histology, results in a high \"false negative\" error rate and frequent recurrences. Margin control (peripheral margins) is necessary to eliminate the false-negative errors. If bread loafing is  used,  distances  from  sections  should  approach 0.1 mm to assure that the method approaches complete margin control. A meta-analysis of the literature in 2014 found no randomized controlled trials of surgical interventions to treat lentigo maligna or melanoma in situ, even though surgery is the most widely used treatment. [142]\n\nMohs  surgery  has  been  done  with  cure  rate  reported  to  be  as  low  as  77%, [111]   and  as  high  as  95%  by  another author. [112]   The \"double scalpel\" peripheral margin controlled excision method approximates the Mohs method in margin control, but requires a pathologist intimately familiar with the complexity of managing the vertical margin on the thin peripheral sections and staining methods. [143]\n\nSome  melanocytic  nevi,  and  melanoma-in-situ  (lentigo  maligna)  have  resolved  with  an  experimental  treatment, imiquimod  (Aldara)  topical  cream,  an  immune  enhancing  agent.  Some  derma-surgeons  are  combining  the  two methods:  surgically  excising  the  cancer  and  then  treating  the  area  with  Aldara  cream  postoperatively  for  three months.  While  some  studies  have  suggested  the  adjuvant  use  of  topical  tazarotene,  the  current  evidence  is insufficient  to  recommend  it  and  suggests  that  it  increases  topical  inflammation,  leading  to  lower  patient compliance. [142]\n\n\n## Radiation\n\nRadiation therapy is often used after surgical resection for patients with locally or regionally advanced melanoma or for patients with unresectable distant metastases. Kilovoltage x-ray beams are often used for these treatments and have the property that the maximum radiation dose occurs close to the skin surface. [144]  It may reduce the rate of local recurrence but does not prolong survival. [145]  Radioimmunotherapy of metastatic melanoma is currently under investigation. Radiotherapy has a role in the palliation of metastatic melanoma. [146]"

        "text": "# Prognosis\n\n\nFactors that affect prognosis include:\n- tumor thickness in millimeters (Breslow's depth),\n- depth related to skin structures (Clark level),\n- type of melanoma,\n- presence of ulceration,\n- presence of lymphatic/perineural invasion,\n- presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (if present, prognosis is better),\n- location of lesion,\n- presence of satellite lesions, and\n- presence of regional or distant metastasis. [ 147]\n\n\nCertain  types  of  melanoma  have  worse  prognoses,  but  this  is  explained  by their thickness. Less invasive melanomas, even with lymph node metastases,\n\ncarry  a  better  prognosis  than  deep  melanomas  without  regional metastasis  at  the  time  of  staging.  Local  recurrences  tend  to behave similarly to a primary unless they are at the site of a wide local  excision  (as  opposed  to  a  staged  excision  or  punch/shave excision)  since  these  recurrences  tend  to  indicate  lymphatic invasion.\n\nWhen  melanomas  have  spread  to  the  lymph  nodes,  one  of  the most important factors is the number of nodes with malignancy. The  extent  of  malignancy  within  a  node  is  also  important; micrometastases, in which malignancy is only microscopic, have a more favorable prognosis than macrometastases. In some cases, micrometastases may only be detected by special staining, and if malignancy  is  only  detectable  by  polymerase  chain  reaction (PCR), the prognosis is better. Macro-metastases in  which\n\nmalignancy is clinically apparent (in some cases, cancer completely replaces a node) have a far worse prognosis, and if nodes are matted or if there is extracapsular extension, the prognosis is worse still. In addition to these variables, expression  levels  and  copy  number  variations  of  several  relevant  genes  may  be  used  to  support  assessment  of melanoma prognosis. [148][149]\n\nStage IV melanoma, in which it has metastasized, is the most deadly skin malignancy: five-year survival is 22.5%. [132] When there is distant metastasis, the cancer is generally considered incurable. The five-year survival rate is less than 10%. [150]  The median survival is 6-12 months. Treatment is palliative, focusing on life extension and quality of life. In  some  cases,  patients  may  live  many  months  or  even  years  with  metastatic  melanoma  (depending  on  the aggressiveness of the treatment). Metastases to the skin and lungs have a better prognosis. Metastases to the brain, bone, and liver are associated with a worse prognosis. Survival is better with metastasis in which the location of the primary tumor is unknown. [151]\n\nThere is not enough definitive evidence to adequately stage, and thus give a prognosis for, ocular melanoma and melanoma of soft  parts,  or  mucosal  melanoma  (e.g.,  rectal  melanoma),  although  these  tend  to  metastasize  more easily. Even though regression may increase survival, when a melanoma has regressed, it is impossible to know its original size, and thus the original tumor is often worse than a pathology report might indicate."

        "text": "About 200 genes are prognostic in melanoma, with both unfavorable genes where high expression is correlated to poor  survival  and  favorable  genes  where  high  expression  is  associated  with  longer  survival  times.  Examples  of unfavorable genes are MCM6 and TIMELESS; an example of a favorable gene is WIPI1. [56][57]\n\nAn increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is associated with worse outcomes. [152][153][154]\n\n\n# Epidemiology\n\nGlobally,  in  2012,  melanoma  occurred  in  232,000  people  and resulted in 55,000 deaths. [2]  Australia and New Zealand have the highest  rates  of  melanoma  in  the  world. [2]   It  has  become  more common in the last 20 years in areas that are mostly Caucasian. [2]\n\nThe  rate  of  melanoma  has  increased  in  recent  years,  but  it  is unclear to what extent changes in behavior, in the environment, or in early detection are involved. [156]\n\n\n## Australia\n\n\nAustralia  has  a  very  high  and  increasing  rate  of  melanoma.  In 2012,  deaths  from  melanoma  occurred  in  7.3-9.8  per  100,000 population.  In  Australia,  melanoma  is  the  third  most  common cancer in both sexes; indeed, its incidence is higher than for lung cancer, although  the  latter accounts  for more  deaths.  It is estimated  that  in  2012,  more  than  12,000  Australians  were diagnosed with melanoma: given Australia's modest population, this is better expressed as 59.6 new cases per 100,000 population per  year;  >1  in  10  of  all  new  cancer  cases  were  melanomas. [157] Melanoma incidence in Australia is a matter of significance, for the following reasons:\n- Australian melanoma incidence has increased by more than 30 per cent between 1991 and 2009.\n- Australian melanoma age-standardized incidence rates were, as of 2008, at least 12 times higher than the world average.\n- Australian melanoma incidence is, by some margin, the highest in the world.\n- Overall age-standardized cancer incidence in Australia is the highest in the world, and this is attributable to melanoma alone. Age-standardized overall cancer incidence is similar to New Zealand, but there is a statistically signifi cant di ff erence between Australia and all other parts of the developed world, including North America, Western Europe, and the Mediterranean.\n\n\n\n## United States\n\nIn the United States, about 8-9,000 people die from melanoma a year, and the death rate from melanoma is 1.40 deaths per 100,000 people. [11][159]\n\nThe incidence of melanoma in the United States increased from 8.8 cases per 100,000  people  in  1975  to  27.7  cases  per  100,000  people  in  2021. [11]   The annual mortality from melanoma decreased 6.1% annually from 2013 to 2017 and 1.4% annually from 2017 to 2022. Advances in treatment are believed to have  caused  the  rapid  decline  in  mortality  over  the  last  decade.

        "text": "2024, in the United States, there were 100,640 cases of melanoma and 8290 deaths. [11]   There  were  also  107,240  cases  of  melanoma  in  situ,  in  which melanoma is confined to the epidermis. [11]\n\nMelanoma is  more  than  20  times  more  common  in  whites  than  in  African Americans. Overall, the lifetime risk of getting melanoma is about 2.5% (1 in 40) for whites, 0.1% (1 in 1,000) for African Americans, and 0.5% (1 in 200) for Mexicans.\n\nMelanomas diagnosed in the US per 100,000 people in 2018. [158] Melanomas affect white people much more often than people in any other racial or ethnic classification.\n\nThe risk of melanoma increases as people age. The average age of people when the disease is diagnosed is 63. [161] 80% of all cases of melanoma (globally) are diagnosed in people older than 50 years. [11]\n\n\n## History\n\nAlthough melanoma is not a new disease, evidence for its occurrence in antiquity is rather  scarce.  However,  one example lies in a 1960s examination of nine Peruvian mummies, radiocarbon dated to be approximately 2400 years old,  which  showed  apparent  signs  of  melanoma:  melanotic  masses  in  the  skin  and  diffuse  metastases  to  the bones. [162]\n\nJohn Hunter is reported to be the first to operate on metastatic melanoma in 1787. Although not knowing precisely what it was, he described it as a \"cancerous fungous excrescence\". The excised tumor was preserved in the Hunterian Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. It was not until 1968 that microscopic examination of the specimen revealed it to be an example of metastatic melanoma. [163]\n\nThe French physician René Laennec was the first to describe melanoma as a disease entity. His report was initially presented during a lecture for the Faculté de Médecine de Paris in 1804 and then published as a bulletin in 1806. [164]\n\nThe first English-language report of melanoma was presented by an English general practitioner from Stourbridge, William  Norris,  in  1820. [165]   In  his  later  work  in  1857  he  remarked  that  there  is  a  familial  predisposition  for development  of  melanoma  ( Eight  Cases  of  Melanosis  with  Pathological  and  Therapeutical  Remarks  on  That Disease ).  Norris  was  also  a  pioneer  in  suggesting  a  link  between  nevi  and  melanoma  and  the  possibility  of  a relationship  between  melanoma  and  environmental  exposures,  by  observing  that  most  of  his  patients  had  pale complexions. [166]  He also described that melanomas could be amelanotic and later showed the metastatic nature of melanoma by observing that they can disseminate to other visceral organs.\n\nThe  first  formal  acknowledgment  of  advanced  melanoma  as  untreatable  came  from  Samuel  Cooper  in  1840.  He stated  that  the  only  chance  for  a  cure  depends  upon  the  early  removal  of  the  disease  (i.e.,  early  excision  of  the malignant mole) ...' [167]\n\nMore than one and a half centuries later, this situation remains largely unchanged.\n\n\n## Terminology\n\nThe  word melanoma came  to  English  from  19th-century  Neo-Latin [168]   and  uses  combining  forms  derived  from ancient Greek roots: melano(denoting melanin) + -oma (denoting a tissue mass and especially a neoplasm), in turn from Greek μέλας melas , \"dark\", [169]  and -ωμα oma , \"process\". The word melanoma has a long history of being used in  a  broader  sense  to  refer  to  any  melanocytic  tumor,  typically,  but  not  always  malignant, [170][171]   but  today  the narrower sense referring only to malignant types has become so dominant that benign tumors are usually not called melanomas anymore and the word melanoma is now usually taken to mean malignant melanoma unless otherwise specified. Terms  such  as \"benign melanocytic tumor\"  unequivocally label the  benign  types,  and  modern histopathologic tumor classifications used in medicine do not use the word for benign tumors.\n\n\n## Research"

        "text": "# Targeted therapies\n\nIn clinical research, adoptive cell therapy and gene therapy, are being tested. [173]\n\nTwo kinds of experimental treatments developed at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) have been used in metastatic melanoma with tentative success. [47]\n\nThe first treatment involves adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using TILs, immune cells (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes) isolated  from  a  person's  own  melanoma  tumor. [130]   These  cells  are  grown  in  large  numbers  in  a  laboratory  and returned to the patient after a treatment that temporarily reduces normal T cells in the patient's body. TIL therapy following lymphodepletion can result in durable complete response in a variety of setups. [174][175]\n\nThe second treatment, adoptive transfer of genetically altered autologous lymphocytes, depends on delivering genes that  encode  so-called  T  cell  receptors  (TCRs)  into  the  patient's  lymphocytes. [130]   After  that  manipulation, lymphocytes recognize and bind to certain molecules found on the surface of melanoma cells and kill them. [176]\n\nA cancer vaccine showed modest benefit in late-stage testing in 2009 against melanoma. [177][178]\n\n\n## BRAF inhibitors\n\nAbout 60% of melanomas contain a mutation in the B-Raf gene. Early clinical trials suggested that B-Raf inhibitors including Plexxicon's vemurafenib could lead to substantial tumor regression in a majority of patients if their tumor contain the B-Raf mutation. [179]  In June 2011, a large clinical trial confirmed the positive findings from those earlier trials. [180][181]\n\nIn August 2011, Vemurafenib received FDA approval for the treatment of late-stage melanoma. In May 2013, the US FDA approved dabrafenib as a single-agent treatment for patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive advanced melanoma. [182]\n\nSome  researchers  believe  that  combination  therapies  that  simultaneously  block  multiple  pathways  may  improve efficacy by making it more difficult for the tumor cells to mutate before being destroyed. In October 2012, a study reported  that  combining  Dabrafenib  with  a  MEK  inhibitor  trametinib  led  to  even  better  outcomes.  Compared  to Dabrafenib alone, progression-free survival was increased to 41% from 9%, and the median progression-free survival increased  to  9.4  months  versus  5.8  months.  Some  side  effects  were,  however,  increased  in  the  combined study. [183][184]\n\nIn January 2014, the FDA approved the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib for the treatment of people with BRAF V600E/K-mutant metastatic melanoma. [185]  In June 2018, the FDA approved the combination of a BRAF inhibitor encorafenib and a MEK inhibitor binimetinib for the treatment of un-resectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation. [186]\n\nEventual resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors may be due to a cell surface protein known as EphA2 which is now being investigated. [187]\n\n\n## Ipilimumab\n\nAt  the  American  Society  of  Clinical  Oncology  Conference  in  June  2010,  the  Bristol  Myers  Squibb  pharmaceutical company reported the clinical findings of their drug ipilimumab. The study found an increase in median survival from 6.4 to 10 months in patients with advanced melanomas treated with the monoclonal ipilimumab, versus an experimental vaccine. It also found a one-year survival rate of 25% in the control group using the vaccine, 44% in the vaccine and ipilimumab group, and 46% in the group treated with ipilimumab alone. [188]  However, some have raised concerns about this study for its use of the unconventional control arm, rather than comparing the drug against a placebo  or  standard  treatment. [189][190]   The  criticism  was  that  although  Ipilimumab  performed  better  than  the vaccine,  the  vaccine  has  not  been  tested  before  and  may  be  causing  toxicity,  making  the  drug  appear  better  by comparison.\n\nIpilimumab was approved by the FDA in March 2011 to treat patients with late-stage melanoma that has spread or cannot be removed by surgery.

        "text": "In June 2011, a clinical trial of ipilimumab plus dacarbazine combined this immune system booster with the standard chemotherapy drug that targets cell division. It showed an increase in median survival for these late-stage patients to 11 months instead of the 9 months normally seen. Researchers were also hopeful of improving the five-year survival rate,  though  serious  adverse  side  effects  were  seen  in  some  patients.  A  course  of  treatment  costs  $120,000.  The drug's brandname is Yervoy. [180][194]\n\n\n# Surveillance methods\n\nAdvances  in  high-resolution  ultrasound  scanning  have  enabled  surveillance  of  metastatic  burden  to  the  sentinel lymph  nodes. [195]   The  Screening  and  Surveillance  of  Ultrasound  in  Melanoma  trial  (SUNMEL)  is  evaluating ultrasound as an alternative to invasive surgical methods. [196]\n\n\n## Oncolytic virotherapy\n\nIn some countries, oncolytic virotherapy methods are studied and used to treat melanoma. Oncolytic virotherapy is a promising branch of virotherapy, where oncolytic viruses are used to treat diseases; viruses can increase metabolism, reduce anti-tumor immunity, and disorganize vasculature. [197]  Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) (which is a herpes simplex virus  type  1-derived  oncolytic  immunotherapy),  was  shown  to  be  useful  against  metastatic  melanoma  in 2015 with an increased survival of 4.4 months. [198][14]\n\n\n## Antivirals\n\nAntiretrovirals have been tested in vitro against melanoma. The rationale behind this lies in their potential to inhibit human endogenous retroviruses, whose activity has been associated with the development of melanoma. [199][200] Evidence from studies on melanoma cell lines indicates that antiretroviral drugs, including lamivudine, doravirine, and cabotegravir, can effectively downregulate the expression of human endogenous retroviruses (HERV-K). These drugs  not  only  reduce  cell  growth  and  invasiveness  but  also  enhance  the  potential  of  immune  checkpoint therapies. [201]  Furthermore, they have shown promise in addressing resistance mechanisms that emerge following prolonged  treatment  with  BRAF  inhibitors  like  dabrafenib  and  AZ628.  By  restoring  apoptosis,  decreasing  cell viability,  and  influencing  tumor  suppressor  proteins,  these  antiretrovirals  offer  a  compelling  strategy  to  tackle therapeutic resistance in melanoma. [202]  Further developments are awaited through animal model testing.\n\n\n## Notes\n\n\n- Incidence is in comparison to all melanomas.\n- A pathological N category is not required for T1 melanomas. In such cases, clinical N information may be used."
