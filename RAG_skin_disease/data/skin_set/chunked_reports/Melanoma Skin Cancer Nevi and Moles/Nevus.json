[1]  The term originates from naevus , which is Latin for \"birthmark\"; however, a nevus can be either congenital (present at birth) or acquired. Common terms ( mole , birthmark , beauty mark , etc.) are  used  to  describe  nevi,  but  these  terms  do  not  distinguish specific types of nevi from one another.\n\n\n## Classification\n\nThe term nevus is applied to a number of conditions caused by neoplasias  and  hyperplasias  of  melanocytes, [2]   as  well  as  a number of pigmentation disorders, both hypermelanotic (containing increased melanin, the pigment responsible for skin color)  and  hypomelanotic  (containing  decreased  melanin). [3] Suspicious skin moles which are multi-colored or pink may be a finding in skin cancer. [4]\n\n\n## Increased melanin\n\n\n## Usually acquired",
