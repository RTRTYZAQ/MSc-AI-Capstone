Most drug-induced cutaneous reactions are mild and disappear  when  the  offending  drug  is  withdrawn. [1]   These  are called  \"simple\"  drug  eruptions.  However,  more  serious  drug eruptions may be associated with organ injury such as liver or kidney damage and are categorized as \"complex\". [2]  Drugs can also cause hair and nail changes, affect the mucous membranes, or cause itching without outward skin changes. [3]\n\nThe use of synthetic pharmaceuticals and biopharmaceuticals in medicine has revolutionized human health, allowing us to live longer lives. Consequently, the average human adult is exposed to  many  drugs  over  longer  treatment  periods  throughout  a lifetime. [4]   This  unprecedented  rise  in  pharmaceutical  use  has led to an increasing number of observed adverse drug reactions. [4]",

        "text": "There are two broad categories of adverse drug reactions. Type A reactions  are  known  side  effects  of  a  drug  that  are  largely predictable  and  are  called, pharmatoxicologic. [5]   Whereas Type  B or hypersensitivity reactions,  are  often  immunemediated  and  reproducible  with  repeated  exposure  to  normal dosages of a given drug. [5] Unlike type A reactions, the mechanism of type B or hypersensitivity  drug  reactions  is  not fully elucidated. However, there is a complex interplay between\n\na patient's inherited genetics, the pharmacotoxicology of the drug and the immune response that ultimately give rise to the manifestation of a drug eruption. [5]\n\nBecause the manifestation of a drug eruption is complex and highly individual, there are many subfields in medicine that are studying this phenomenon. For example, the field of pharmacogenomics aims to prevent the occurrence of severe adverse drug reactions by analyzing a person's inherited genetic risk. [6]  As such, there are  clinical  examples  of  inherited  genetic  alleles  that  are  known  to  predict  drug  hypersensitivities  and  for which diagnostic testing is available.

As such, there are some FDA recommended genetic screening tests available for certain drugs and ethnic populations to prevent the occurrence of a drug eruption. [5]  The most well known example is carbamezepine (an anti-convulsant used to treat seizures) hypersensitivity  associated  with  the  presence  of  HLA-B*5801  genetic  allele  in  Asian populations.

[2] Worsening of systemic symptoms occurs 3-4 days after cessation of the offending drug. [5]  There are genetic risk alleles that are predictive of the development of DIHS for particular drugs and ethnic populations. [5]  The most important of which is abacavir (an anti-viral used in the treatment of HIV) hypersensitivity associated with  the  presence  of  the  HLA-B*5701  allele  in  European  and  African  population  in  the  United  States  and Australians.

This testing should be performed within one month after resolution of the rash and patch test results are interpreted at different time points: 48 hours, 72hours and even later at 96 hours and 120 hours in order to improve the sensitivity.
