Both vesicles and bullae are fluid-filled lesions, and they are distinguished  by  size  (vesicles  being  less  than  5-10  mm  and bulla  being  larger  than  5-10  mm,  depending  upon  which definition is used). In the case of vesiculobullous diseases which are also  immune  disorders,  the  term immunobullous [1] is sometimes used. Examples of vesiculobullous diseases include:\n- Infectious: (viral)\n- Herpes simplex\n- Varicella-Zoster infection\n- Hand, foot and mouth disease\n- Herpangina\n- Measles (Rubeola)\n- Immunobullous:\n- Pemphigus vulgaris [2]\n- Pemphigoid\n- Dermatitis herpetiformis[1] (https://books.google.com/books?id=N0ng2f1hxn4C&dq=Dermatitis+ herpetiformis+is+a+vesiculobullous+disease&pg=PA161)\n- Linear immunoglobulin-A disease (linear IgA disease)\n- Genetic:\n- Epidermolysis bullosa [3]",
