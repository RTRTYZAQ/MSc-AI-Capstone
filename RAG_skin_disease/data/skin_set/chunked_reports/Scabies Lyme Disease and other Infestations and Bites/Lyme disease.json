[4][9][10] It is the most common disease spread by ticks in the Northern Hemisphere. [11][8]   Infections  are  most  common  in  the  spring and early summer. [4]\n\nThe most common sign of infection is an expanding red rash, known as erythema migrans (EM), which appears at the site of the  tick  bite  about  a  week  afterwards. [1]   The  rash  is  typically neither itchy nor painful. [1]  Approximately 70-80% of infected people  develop  a  rash. [1]   Other  early  symptoms  may  include fever,  headaches and tiredness. [1]   If  untreated,  symptoms  may include loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the face, joint  pains,  severe  headaches  with  neck  stiffness  or  heart palpitations. [1]  Months to years later, repeated episodes of joint pain and swelling may occur. [1]  Occasionally, shooting pains or tingling in the arms and legs may develop. [1]",

[70]  Most infections are caused by ticks in the nymphal stage,  because they are tiny, and may thus feed undetected for long periods of time. [69]  Nymphal ticks are generally the size of a poppy seed and sometimes with a dark head and a translucent body. [71]  Or, the nymphal ticks can be darker. [72]  The younger larval ticks are very rarely infected.

The extent to which a tick can feed, reproduce, and spread will depend on the type and availability of its hosts. Whether it will spread disease is also affected by its available hosts. Some species, such as lizards, are referred to as \"dilution hosts\" because they don't tend to support Lyme disease pathogens and decrease the likelihood that the disease will be passed on by ticks feeding on them. Whitetailed deer are both a food source and a \"reproductive host\", where ticks tend to mate. [229]  The white-footed mouse is a reservoir host in which the pathogen for Lyme disease can survive. The availability of hosts can have significant impacts on the transmission of Lyme disease. A greater diversity of hosts, or of those that don't support the pathogen, tends to decrease the likelihood that the disease will be transmitted. [153]",

One  study has found that before the reforestation that accompanied  post-colonial  farm abandonment in New England and the wholesale migration into the Midwest that occurred during the early 19th century, Lyme disease had been present for thousands of years in America and had spread along with its tick hosts from the Northeast to the Midwest. [267]\n\nJohn  Josselyn,  who  visited  New  England  in  1638  and  again  from  1663  to  1670,  wrote,  \"There  be  infinite numbers of ticks hanging upon the bushes in summertime that will cleave to man's garments and creep into his breeches, eating themselves in a short time into the very flesh of a man. I have seen the stockings of those that have gone through the woods covered with them.\" [268]",

When Kalm's journey was retraced 100 years later, the forests were gone and the Lyme bacterium had probably become isolated to a few pockets along the northeast coast, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. [269]\n\nPerhaps the first detailed description of what is now known as Lyme disease appeared in the writings of John Walker after a visit to the island of Jura (Deer Island) off the west coast of Scotland in 1764. [270]  He gives a good description both of the symptoms of Lyme disease (with \"exquisite pain [in] the interior parts of the limbs\") and of the tick vector itself, which he describes as a \"worm\" with a body which is \"of a reddish color and of a compressed shape with a row of feet on each side\" that \"penetrates the skin\". Many people from this area of Great Britain emigrated to North America between 1717 and the end of the 18th century. [271]",

In many areas, the expansion of suburban neighborhoods has led to the gradual deforestation of surrounding wooded areas and increased border contact between humans and tick-dense areas. Human expansion has also resulted in a reduction of predators that hunt deer as well as mice, chipmunks and other small rodents-the primary reservoirs for Lyme disease. As a consequence of increased human contact with host and vector, the likelihood of transmission of the disease has greatly increased.

[4][9][10] It is the most common disease spread by ticks in the Northern Hemisphere. [11][8]   Infections  are  most  common  in  the  spring and early summer. [4]\n\nThe most common sign of infection is an expanding red rash, known as erythema migrans (EM), which appears at the site of the  tick  bite  about  a  week  afterwards. [1]   The  rash  is  typically neither itchy nor painful. [1]  Approximately 70-80% of infected people  develop  a  rash. [1]   Other  early  symptoms  may  include fever,  headaches and tiredness. [1]   If  untreated,  symptoms  may include loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the face, joint  pains,  severe  headaches  with  neck  stiffness  or  heart palpitations. [1]  Months to years later, repeated episodes of joint pain and swelling may occur. [1]  Occasionally, shooting pains or tingling in the arms and legs may develop. [1]\n\nDiagnosis  is  based  on  a  combination  of  symptoms,  history  of tick exposure, and possibly testing for specific antibodies in the blood. [5][12]   If  an  infection  develops,  several  antibiotics  are effective,  including  doxycycline,  amoxicillin  and  cefuroxime. [4] Standard  treatment  usually  lasts  for  two  or  three  weeks. [4] People  with  persistent  symptoms  after  appropriate  treatments are  said  to  have  Post-Treatment  Lyme  Disease  Syndrome (PTLDS). [13]\n\nPrevention  includes  efforts  to  prevent  tick  bites  by  wearing clothing  to  cover  the  arms  and  legs  and  using  DEET  or picaridin-based insect repellents.

        "text": "# Early localized infection\n\nApproximately  80%  of  Lyme  infections  begin  with  a rash  of  some  sort  at  the  site  of  a  tick  bite,  often  near skin folds such as the armpit, groin, back of the knee, or the  trunk  under  clothing  straps,  or  in  children's  hair, ears, or neck. [15][4]  Most people who get infected do not remember  seeing  a  tick  or  a  bite.  The  rash  appears typically one or two weeks (range 3-32 days) after the bite and expands 2-3 cm (around 1 inch) per day up to a  diameter  of  5-70  cm  (2  to  28  inches)  (median  is 16 cm; 6 inches). [15][4][19]\n\nThe rash is usually circular or oval, red or bluish, and may  have  an  elevated  or  darker  center. [4][16][17]   This rash  is  termed  an  erythema  migrans  (EM),  which translates  as  \"migrating  redness.\"  In  approximately 79% of cases in Europe, this rash gradually clears from the center toward the edges, possibly forming a \"bull's\n\neye\"  or  \"target-like\"  pattern.  This  clearing  only  happens  in  19%  of  cases  in  endemic  areas  of  the  United States. [19][16][17]  The rash may feel warm, usually is not itchy, is rarely tender or painful, and takes up to four weeks to resolve if untreated. [4]\n\nThe  Lyme  rash  is  often  accompanied  by  symptoms  of  a  flu-like  illness,  including  fatigue,  headache,  body aches, fever, and chills [though usually neither nausea nor upper-respiratory problems]. These symptoms may also appear without a rash or linger after the rash has disappeared. Lyme can progress to later stages without a rash or these symptoms. [4]\n\nPeople with high fever for more than two days or whose other symptoms of viral-like illness do not improve despite  antibiotic  treatment  for  Lyme  disease,  or  who  have  abnormally  low  levels  of  white  or  red  cells  or platelets in the blood, should be investigated for possible coinfection with other tick-borne diseases such as ehrlichiosis and babesiosis. [22]\n\nNot everyone with Lyme disease has all the symptoms. Many of these symptoms can also occur with other diseases. [23]   This  can  make  obtaining  a  diagnosis  particularly  challenging,  especially  with  the  rise  of  coinfection.\n\nAsymptomatic  infection  exists,  but  some  studies  suggest  that  this  occurs  in  less  than  7%  of  infected individuals in the United States as opposed to about 50-70% of cases in Europe. [24]\n\n\n## Early disseminated infection\n\nWithin  days  to  weeks  after  the  onset  of  local  infection,  the Borrelia bacteria  may  spread  through  the lymphatic system or bloodstream. In 10-20% of untreated cases, EM rashes develop at sites across the body that bear no relation to the original tick bite. [15]  Transient muscle pains and joint pains are also common. [15]\n\nIn  about  10-15%  of  untreated  people,  Lyme  causes  neurological  problems  known  as  neuroborreliosis. [25] Early neuroborreliosis typically appears 4-6 weeks (range 1-12 weeks) after the tick bite and involves some combination of lymphocytic meningitis, cranial neuritis, radiculopathy, and/or mononeuritis multiplex. [22][26]  Lymphocytic meningitis causes characteristic changes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and may be accompanied for several  weeks  by  variable  headache  and,  less  commonly,  usually  mild  meningitis signs such as inability to flex the neck fully and intolerance to bright lights but typically no or only very low fever. [27]  After several months neuroborreliosis can also present otolaryngological symptoms. Up to 76.5% of them present as tinnitus, the most common symptom. Vertigo and dizziness (53.7%) and hearing loss (16.7%) were  the  next  most  common  symptoms. [28]   In  children,  partial  loss  of  vision  may  also  occur. [22]   Cranial neuritis  is  an  inflammation  of  cranial  nerves.  When  due  to  Lyme,  it  most  typically  causes  facial  palsy, impairing  blinking,  smiling,  and  chewing  on  one  or  both  sides  of  the  face.  It  may  also  cause  intermittent double vision. [22][27]  Lyme radiculopathy is an inflammation of spinal nerve roots that often causes pain and less often weakness, numbness, or altered sensation in the areas of the body served by nerves connected to the affected roots, e.g. limb(s) or part(s) of trunk. The pain is often described as unlike any other previously felt, excruciating,  migrating,  worse  at  night,  rarely  symmetrical,  and  often  accompanied  by  extreme  sleep disturbance. [26][29]   Mononeuritis  multiplex  is  an  inflammation  causing  similar  symptoms  in  one  or  more unrelated peripheral nerves. [25][22]  Rarely, early neuroborreliosis may involve inflammation of the brain or spinal  cord,  with  symptoms  such  as  confusion,  abnormal  gait,  ocular  movements,  or  speech,  impaired movement, impaired motor planning, or shaking.

        "text": "In  North  America,  facial  palsy  is  the  typical  early  neuroborreliosis  presentation,  occurring  in  5-10%  of untreated people, in about 75% of cases accompanied by lymphocytic meningitis. [22][30]  Lyme radiculopathy is reported half as frequently, but many cases may be unrecognized. [31]  In European adults, the most common presentation is a combination of lymphocytic meningitis and radiculopathy known as Bannwarth syndrome, accompanied in 36-89% of cases by facial palsy. [26][29]  In this syndrome, radicular pain tends to start in the same body region as the initial erythema migrans rash, if there was one, and precedes possible facial palsy and other impaired movement. [29]  In extreme cases, permanent impairment of motor or sensory function of the lower limbs may occur. [32]  In European children, the most common manifestations are facial palsy (in 55%), other cranial neuritis, and lymphocytic meningitis (in 27%). [26]\n\nIn about 4-10% of untreated cases in the United States and 0.3-4% of untreated cases in Europe, typically between June and December, about one month (range 4 days to 7 months) after the tick bite, the infection may cause heart complications known as Lyme carditis. [33][34]  Symptoms may include heart palpitations (in 69% of people), dizziness, fainting, shortness of breath, and chest pain. [33]  Other symptoms of Lyme disease may also  be  present,  such  as  EM  rash,  joint  aches,  facial  palsy,  headaches,  or  radicular  pain. [33]   In  some people,  however,  carditis  may  be  the  first  manifestation  of  Lyme  disease. [33]   Lyme  carditis  in  19-87%  of people adversely impacts the heart's electrical  conduction  system,  causing  atrioventricular  block  that  often manifests  as  heart  rhythms  that  alternate  within  minutes  between  abnormally  slow  and  abnormally fast. [33][34]  In 10-15% of people, Lyme causes myocardial complications such as cardiomegaly, left ventricular dysfunction, or congestive heart failure. [33]\n\nAnother skin condition,  found  in  Europe  but  not  in  North  America,  is  borrelial  lymphocytoma,  a  purplish lump that develops on the ear lobe, nipple, or scrotum. [35]\n\n\n## Late disseminated infection\n\nLyme  arthritis  occurs  in  up  to  60%  of  untreated  people,  typically starting about six months after infection. [15]  It usually affects only one or a few joints, often a knee or possibly the hip, other large joints, or the temporomandibular joint. [22][37]  Usually, large joint effusion and swelling occur, but only mild or moderate pain. [22] Without treatment, swelling and pain typically resolve over time, but periodically return. [22]  Baker's cysts may form and rupture.\n\nIn early US studies of Lyme disease, a rare peripheral neuropathy was described that included numbness, tingling, or burning starting at the feet or hands and, over time, possibly moving up the limbs. In a later analysis  that  discovered  poor  documentation  of  this  manifestation, experts  wondered  if  it  exists  at  all  in  the  US  or  is  merely  very rare. [22][38]\n\nA neurologic syndrome called Lyme encephalopathy is associated with subtle memory and cognitive difficulties, insomnia, a general sense of feeling  unwell,  and  changes in personality. [39]   Lyme  encephalopathy is  controversial  in  the  US  and  has  not  been  reported  in  Europe. [8]   Problems  such  as  depression  and fibromyalgia  are  as  common  in  people  with  Lyme  disease  as  in  the  general  population. [40][41]   There  is  no compelling  evidence  that  Lyme  disease  causes  psychiatric  disorders,  behavioral  disorders  (e.g.  ADHD),  or developmental disorders (e.g. autism). [42]"

        "text": "Acrodermatitis  chronica  atrophicans  is  a  chronic  skin  disorder  observed  primarily  in  Europe  among  the elderly. [35]  It begins as a reddish-blue patch of discolored skin, often on the backs of the hands or feet. The lesion slowly atrophies over several weeks or months, with the skin becoming first thin and wrinkled and then, if untreated, completely dry and hairless. [43]\n\n\n# Cause\n\nLyme disease  is  caused  by  spirochetes,  gram-negative  bacteria  from the genus Borrelia . Spirochetes are surrounded by peptidoglycan and flagella. [44]   The Lyme-related Borrelia species are collectively known as Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato ,  and  show a great deal of genetic diversity. [45]\n\nB. burgdorferi sensu lato is a species complex made up of 20 accepted and  three  proposed  genospecies.  Eight  species  are  known  to  cause Lyme disease: B.  mayonii (found  in  North  America), B.  burgdorferi sensu  stricto (found  in  North  America  and  Europe), B.  afzelii , B. garinii,  B.  spielmanii, and B.  lusitaniae (all  found  in  Eurasia). [a] Some studies have also proposed that B.  valaisiana may  sometimes infect humans. This species does not appear to be an important cause of disease. [49][50]\n\n\n## Ticks\n\n\n## Tick life cycle\n\nThree stages occur in the life cycle of a tick: larva, nymph, and adult. During the nymph stage, ticks most frequently transmit Lyme disease and  are  typically  most  active  in  late  spring  and  early  summer  in regions  with  a  mild  climate.  During  the  adult  stage,  Lyme  disease transmission is less common because adult ticks are less likely to bite humans  and  tend  to  be  larger,  so  they  can  be  easily  seen  and removed. [51]\n\n\n## Tick appearance changes when feeding\n\nBoth  nymph  and  female  ticks  increase in  size  (engorge)  when feeding. [52]\n\n\n## Types of ticks, and hosts\n\nLyme disease is transmitted to humans by the bites of infected ticks of the genus Ixodes . [53]   In  the  United States, Ixodes scapularis is the primary vector. In Europe, Ixodes ricinus ticks may spread the bacteria more quickly. [54][55]   In  North  America,  the  bacterial  species Borrelia  burgdorferi and B.  mayonii cause  Lyme disease. [4][48]  In Europe and Asia, Borrelia afzelii, Borrelia garinii, B. spielmanii and four other species also cause the disease. [4]\n\nWhile B.  burgdorferi is  most  associated  with  ticks  hosted  by  white-tailed  deer  and  white-footed  mice, Borrelia afzelii is most frequently detected in rodent-feeding vector ticks, and Borrelia garinii and Borrelia valaisiana appear to be associated with birds. Both rodents and birds are competent reservoir hosts for B."

The  resistance  of  a  genospecies  of  Lyme disease  spirochetes  to  the  bacteriolytic  activities  of  the  alternative complement  pathway  of  various  host  species  may  determine  its reservoir host association. [56]\n\nBudding research has suggested  that B.  burgdorferi  sensu  lato may also be able to form enzootic cycle among lizard populations; [57]  this was previously assumed not to be possible in major areas containing populations  of  lizards,  such  as  California.  Except  for  one  study  in Europe, [56]   much  of  the  data  implicating  lizards  is  based  on  DNA detection of the spirochete and has not demonstrated that lizards can infect ticks feeding  on  them. [57][58][59][60]   As  some  experiments suggest  lizards  are  refractory  to  infection  with Borrelia ,  it  appears likely  their  involvement  in  the  enzootic  cycle  is  more  complex  and species-specific. [61]\n\nIn Europe, the main vector is Ixodes ricinus ,  which is also called the sheep  tick  or  castor  bean  tick. [62]   In  China, Ixodes  persulcatus (the taiga tick) is probably  the  most  important  vector. [63]   In  North America, the black-legged tick or deer tick ( Ixodes scapularis )  is  the main vector on the East Coast. [64]\n\nThe  lone star tick ( Amblyomma  americanum ), which  is  found throughout  the  Southeastern  United  States  as  far  west  as  Texas,  is unlikely to transmit the Lyme disease spirochetes, [65]  though it may be  implicated  in  a  related  syndrome  called  southern  tick-associated rash illness, which resembles a mild form of Lyme disease. [66]\n\nOn the West Coast of the United States, the main vector is the western black-legged  tick  ( Ixodes  pacificus ). [67]   The  tendency  of  this  tick  species  to  feed  predominantly  on  host species  such  as  the  western  fence  lizard  that  are  resistant  to Borrelia infection  appears  to  diminish transmission of Lyme disease in the West. [68][61]\n\n\n## Transmission\n\n\n## Mechanism\n\nLyme disease is classified as a zoonosis, as it is transmitted to humans from a natural reservoir among small mammals and birds by ticks that feed on both sets of hosts. [69]  Hard-bodied ticks of the genus Ixodes are the vectors of Lyme disease (also the vector for Babesia ). [70]  Most infections are caused by ticks in the nymphal stage,  because they are tiny, and may thus feed undetected for long periods of time. [69]  Nymphal ticks are generally the size of a poppy seed and sometimes with a dark head and a translucent body. [71]  Or, the nymphal ticks can be darker. [72]  The younger larval ticks are very rarely infected. [64]  Although deer are the preferred hosts of adult deer ticks, and tick populations are much lower in the absence of deer, ticks generally do not acquire Borrelia from deer; instead, they obtain them from infected small mammals such as the white-footed mouse, and occasionally birds. [73]  Areas where Lyme is common are expanding. [74]\n\nWithin the tick midgut, the Borrelia 's  outer  surface  protein  A  (OspA)  binds  to  the  tick  receptor  for  OspA, known as TROSPA. When the tick feeds, the Borrelia downregulates OspA and upregulates OspC, another surface protein. After the bacteria migrate from the midgut to the salivary glands, OspC binds to Salp15, a tick salivary  protein  that  appears  to  have  immunosuppressive  effects  that  enhance  infection. [75]   Successful infection of the mammalian host depends on bacterial expression of OspC. [76]"

        "text": "# Duration of attachment\n\nReviews have considered whether the length of time of attachment impacts transmission. [77][78]\n\n\n## Prevalence\n\nTick  bites  often  go  unnoticed  because  of  the  small  size  of  the  tick  in  its  nymphal  stage,  as  well  as  tick secretions that prevent the host from feeling any itch or pain from the bite. However, transmission is quite rare, with only about 1.2 to 1.4 percent of recognized tick bites resulting in Lyme disease. [79]\n\n\n## In pregnancy\n\nLyme disease spreading from mother to fetus is possible but extremely rare, and with antibiotic treatment, there  is  no  increased  risk  of  adverse  birth  outcomes. [80]   NICE  guidance  is  that  antibiotics  appropriate  for pregnancy  be  used. [81]   There  are  no  studies  on  developmental  outcomes  of  children  whose  mothers  had Lyme. [80]\n\n\n## Other human transmission\n\nThere is no scientific evidence to support Lyme disease transmission via blood transfusion, sexual contact, or breast milk. [82][80]\n\n\n## Tick-borne co-infections\n\nTicks  that  transmit B.  burgdorferi to  humans  can  also  carry  and  transmit  several  other  microbes,  such  as Babesia  microti and Anaplasma  phagocytophilum ,  which  cause  the  diseases  babesiosis  and  human granulocytic  anaplasmosis  (HGA),  respectively. [83]   Among  people  with  early  Lyme  disease,  depending  on their  location,  2-12% will also have HGA and 2-10% will have babesiosis. [42]  Ticks in certain regions also transmit viruses that cause tick-borne encephalitis and Powassan virus disease. [84][42]  Co-infections of Lyme disease may not require additional treatment, since they may resolve on their own or-as in the case of HGAcan  be  treated  with  the  doxycycline  prescribed  for  Lyme. [22]   Persistent  fever  or  compatible  anomalous laboratory findings may be indicative of a co-infection. [42]\n\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\nB. burgdorferi can spread throughout the body during the course of the disease, and has been found in the skin,  heart,  joints,  peripheral  nervous  system,  and  central  nervous  system. [76][85] B.  Burgdorferi does  not produce toxins. [86]   Therefore,  many  of  the  signs  and  symptoms  of  Lyme  disease  are  a  consequence  of  the immune response to the spirochete in those tissues. [87]\n\nB.  burgdorferi is  injected  into  the  skin  by  the  bite  of  an  infected Ixodes tick. [88]   Tick  saliva,  which accompanies  the  spirochete  into  the  skin  during  the  feeding  process,  contains  substances  that  disrupt  the immune response at the site of the bite. [89]  This provides a protective environment where the spirochete can establish infection. The spirochetes multiply and migrate outward within the dermis. The host inflammatory response  to  the  bacteria  in  the  skin  causes  the  characteristic  circular  EM  lesion. [76]   Neutrophils,  however, which are necessary to eliminate the spirochetes from the skin, fail to appear in necessary numbers in the developing EM lesion because tick saliva inhibits neutrophil function. This allows the bacteria to survive and eventually spread throughout the body. [90]\n\nDays to  weeks  following  the  tick  bite,  the  spirochetes  spread  via  the  bloodstream  to  joints,  heart,  nervous system, and distant skin sites, where their presence gives rise to the variety of symptoms of the disseminated disease. The spread of B. burgdorferi is aided by the attachment of the host protease plasmin to the surface of the spirochete. [91]"

        "text": "If  untreated,  the  bacteria  may  persist  in  the  body  for  months  or  even  years,  despite  the  production  of B. burgdorferi antibodies  by  the  immune  system. [92]   The  spirochetes  may  avoid  the  immune  response  by decreasing  expression  of  surface  proteins  that  are  targeted  by  antibodies,  antigenic  variation  of  the  VlsE surface  protein,  inactivating  key  immune  components such as complement, and hiding in the extracellular matrix, which may interfere with the function of immune factors. [93][94]\n\n\n# Immunological studies\n\nExposure  to  the Borrelia bacterium  during  Lyme  disease  possibly  causes  a  long-lived  and  damaging inflammatory  response, [95]   a  form  of  pathogen-induced  autoimmune  disease. [96]   The  production  of  this reaction  might  be  due  to  a  form  of  molecular  mimicry,  where Borrelia avoids  being  killed  by  the  immune system by resembling normal parts of the body's tissues. [97][98]\n\nChronic symptoms from an autoimmune reaction could explain why certain symptoms persist even after the spirochetes have been eliminated from the body. This hypothesis may explain why chronic arthritis persists after antibiotic therapy, similar to rheumatic fever, but its wider application is controversial. [99][100]\n\n\n## Diagnosis\n\nLyme disease is diagnosed based on symptoms, objective physical findings (such as erythema migrans (EM) rash,  facial  palsy,  or  arthritis),  history  of  possible  exposure  to  infected  ticks,  and  possibly  laboratory tests. [4][15]   People with symptoms of early Lyme disease should have a total body skin examination for EM rashes and be asked whether EM-type rashes had manifested within the last 1-2 months. [22]  Presence of an EM rash and recent tick exposure (i.e., being outdoors in a likely tick habitat where Lyme is common, within 30 days of the appearance of the rash) are sufficient for Lyme diagnosis; no laboratory confirmation is needed or recommended. [4][15][101][102]  Most people who get infected do not remember a tick or a bite, and the EM rash  need  not  look  like  a  bull's  eye  (most  EM  rashes  in  the  U.S.  do  not)  or  be  accompanied  by  any  other symptoms. [4][103]  In the U.S., Lyme is most common in the New England and Mid-Atlantic states and parts of Wisconsin and Minnesota, but it is expanding into other areas. [74]   Several  bordering  areas  of  Canada  also have high Lyme risk. [104]\n\nIn  the  absence  of  an  EM  rash  or  history  of  tick  exposure,  Lyme  diagnosis  depends  on  laboratory confirmation. [70][105]  The bacteria that cause Lyme disease are difficult to observe directly in body tissues and also difficult and too time-consuming to grow in the laboratory. [4][70]  The most widely used tests look instead for presence of antibodies against those bacteria in the blood. [106]  A positive antibody test result does not by itself  prove  active  infection,  but  can  confirm  an  infection  that  is  suspected  because  of  symptoms,  objective findings, and history of tick exposure in a person. [70]  Because as many as 5-20% of the normal population have antibodies against Lyme, people without a history and symptoms suggestive of Lyme disease should not be  tested  for  Lyme  antibodies:  a  positive  result  would  likely  be  false,  possibly  causing  unnecessary treatment. [22][26]\n\nIn some cases, when history, signs, and symptoms are strongly suggestive of early disseminated Lyme disease, empiric treatment may be started and reevaluated as laboratory test results become available. [30][107]\n\n\n## Laboratory testing\n\nTests  for  antibodies  in  the  blood  by  ELISA  and  Western  blot  are  the  most  widely  used  methods  for  Lyme diagnosis. A two-tiered protocol is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): the sensitive ELISA test is performed first, and if it is positive or equivocal, then the more specific Western blot is run. [108]  The immune system takes some time to produce antibodies in quantity. After Lyme infection onset, antibodies of types IgM and IgG usually can first be detected respectively at 2-4 weeks and 4-6 weeks, and  peak  at  6-8  weeks. [109]   When  an  EM  rash  first  appears,  detectable  antibodies  may  not  be  present. Therefore, it is recommended that testing not be performed and diagnosis be based on the presence of the EM rash. [22]  Up to 30 days after suspected Lyme infection onset, infection can be confirmed by detection of IgM"

        "text": "or IgG antibodies; after that, it is recommended that only IgG antibodies be considered. [109]  A positive IgM and  negative  IgG  test  result  after  the  first  month  of  infection  is  generally  indicative  of  a  false-positive result. [110]  The number of IgM antibodies usually collapses 4-6 months after infection, while IgG antibodies can remain detectable for years. [109]\n\nOther tests may be used in neuroborreliosis cases. In Europe, neuroborreliosis is usually caused by Borrelia garinii  and  almost  always  involves  lymphocytic  pleocytosis,  i.e.,  the  densities  of  lymphocytes  (infectionfighting cells) and protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) typically rise to characteristically abnormal levels, while glucose level remains normal. [27][22][29]  Additionally, the immune system produces antibodies against Lyme inside the intrathecal space, which contains the CSF. [22][29]   Demonstration  by  lumbar  puncture  and CSF  analysis  of  pleocytosis  and  intrathecal  antibody  production  are  required  for  definite  diagnosis  of neuroborreliosis in Europe (except in cases of peripheral neuropathy associated with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, which usually is caused by Borrelia afzelii and confirmed by blood antibody tests). [26]  In North America, neuroborreliosis is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and may not be accompanied by the same CSF signs;  they  confirm  a  diagnosis  of  central  nervous  system  (CNS)  neuroborreliosis  if  positive,  but  do  not exclude it if negative. [111]  American guidelines consider CSF analysis optional when symptoms appear to be confined to the peripheral nervous system (PNS), e.g., facial palsy without overt meningitis symptoms. [22][112] Unlike blood and intrathecal antibody tests, CSF pleocytosis tests revert to normal after infection ends and therefore  can  be  used  as  objective  markers  of  treatment  success  and  inform  decisions  on  whether  to retreat. [29]   In  infection  involving  the  PNS,  electromyography  and  nerve  conduction  studies  can  be  used  to monitor objectively the response to treatment. [27]\n\nIn Lyme carditis, electrocardiograms are used to evidence heart conduction abnormalities, while echocardiography  may  show  myocardial  dysfunction. [33]   Biopsy  and  confirmation  of  Borrelia  cells  in myocardial  tissue  may  be  used  in  specific  cases,  but  are  usually  not  done  because  of  the  risk  of  the procedure. [33]\n\nPolymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR)  tests  for  Lyme  disease  have  also  been  developed  to  detect  the  genetic material  (DNA)  of  the  Lyme  disease  spirochete.  Culture  or  PCR  are  the  current  means  for  detecting  the presence of the organism, as serologic studies only test for antibodies of Borrelia . PCR has the advantage of being much faster than culture. However, PCR tests are susceptible to false positive results, e.g., by detection of debris of dead Borrelia cells or specimen contamination. [113][26]  Even when properly performed, PCR often shows false-negative results because few Borrelia cells can be found in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during  infection. [114][26]   Hence,  PCR  tests  are  recommended  only  in  special  cases,  e.g.,  diagnosis  of  Lyme arthritis,  because  it  is  a  highly  sensitive  way  of  detecting ospA DNA  in  synovial  fluid. [115]   Although  the sensitivity of PCR in CSF is low, its use may be considered when intrathecal antibody production test results are suspected of being falsely negative, e.g., in very early (< 6 weeks) neuroborreliosis or in immunosuppressed people. [26]\n\nSeveral  other  forms  of  laboratory  testing  for  Lyme  disease  are  available,  some  of  which  have  not  been adequately  validated.  OspA  antigens,  shed  by  live Borrelia bacteria  into  urine,  are  a  promising  technique being studied. [116]  The use of nanotrap particles for their detection is being examined. The OspA protein has been  linked  to  active  symptoms  of  Lyme. [117][118]   High  titers  of  either  immunoglobulin  G  (IgG)  or immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to Borrelia antigens indicate disease, but lower titers can be misleading, because  the  IgM  antibodies  may  remain  after  the  initial  infection,  and  IgG  antibodies  may  remain  for years. [119]\n\nThe CDC does not recommend urine antigen tests, PCR tests on urine, immunofluorescent staining for cellwall-deficient forms of B. burgdorferi , and lymphocyte transformation tests. [114]\n\n\n## Imaging\n\nNeuroimaging is controversial in whether it provides specific patterns unique to neuroborreliosis, but may aid in differential diagnosis and in understanding the pathophysiology of the disease. [120]  Though controversial, some evidence shows certain neuroimaging tests can provide data that are helpful in the diagnosis of a person."

        "text": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are two tests that can identify abnormalities in the brain of a person affected with this disease. Neuroimaging findings in an MRI include lesions in the periventricular white matter, as well as enlarged ventricles and cortical atrophy. The findings are considered somewhat unexceptional because the lesions have been found to be reversible following  antibiotic  treatment.  Images  produced  using  SPECT  show  numerous  areas  where  an  insufficient amount of blood is being delivered to the cortex and subcortical white matter. However, SPECT images are known to be nonspecific because they show a heterogeneous pattern in the imaging. The abnormalities seen in the  SPECT  images  are  very  similar  to  those  seen  in  people  with  cerebral  vasculitis  and  Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which makes them questionable. [121]\n\n\n# Differential diagnosis\n\nCommunity clinics have been reported to misdiagnose 23-28% of erythema migrans (EM) rashes and 83% of other objective manifestations of early Lyme disease. [105]  EM rashes are often misdiagnosed as spider bites, cellulitis, or shingles. [105]  Many misdiagnoses are credited to the widespread misconception that EM rashes should look like  a  bull's  eye. [4]   Actually,  the  key  distinguishing  features  of  the  EM  rash  are  the  speed  and extent to which it expands, respectively up to 2-3 cm (around 1 inch) per day and a diameter of at least 5 cm (2 inches), and in 50% of cases more than 16 cm (6 inches). The rash expands away from its center, which may or may not look different or be separated by a ring-like clearing from the rest of the rash. [15][19]  Compared to EM rashes, spider bites are more common in the limbs, tend to be more painful and itchy or become swollen, and some may cause necrosis (sinking dark blue patch of dead skin). [15][4]  Cellulitis most commonly develops around a wound or ulcer, is rarely circular, and is more likely to become swollen and tender. [15][4]  EM rashes often appear at sites that are unusual for cellulitis, such as the armpit, groin, abdomen, or back of the knee. [15] Like Lyme, shingles often begins with headache, fever, and fatigue, which are followed by pain or numbness. However,  unlike  Lyme,  in  shingles,  these  symptoms  are  usually  followed  by  the  appearance  of  rashes composed of multiple small blisters along with a nerve's dermatome, and shingles can also be confirmed by quick laboratory tests. [122]\n\nFacial palsy caused by Lyme disease (LDFP) is often misdiagnosed as Bell's palsy. [30]  Although Bell's palsy is the most common type of one-sided facial palsy (about 70% of cases), LDFP can account for about 25% of cases of facial palsy in areas where Lyme disease is common. [30]  Compared to LDFP, Bell's palsy much less frequently affects both sides of the face. [30]  Even though LDFP and Bell's palsy have similar symptoms and evolve similarly if untreated, corticosteroid treatment is beneficial for Bell's Palsy, while being detrimental for LDFP. [30]   Recent  history  of  exposure  to  a  likely  tick  habitat  during  warmer  months,  EM  rash,  viral-like symptoms such as headache and fever,  and/or  palsy  in  both  sides  of  the  face  should  be  evaluated  for  the likelihood of LDFP; if it is more than minimal, empiric therapy with antibiotics should be initiated, without corticosteroids, and reevaluated upon completion of laboratory tests for Lyme disease. [30]\n\nUnlike viral meningitis, Lyme lymphocytic meningitis tends not to cause fever, last longer, or recur. [27][22] Lymphocytic meningitis is also characterized by possibly co-occurring with EM rash, facial palsy, or partial vision obstruction and having much lower percentage of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in CSF. [22]\n\nLyme  radiculopathy  affecting  the  limbs  is  often  misdiagnosed  as  a  radiculopathy  caused  by  nerve  root compression, such as sciatica. [105][123]  Although most cases of radiculopathy are compressive and resolve with conservative treatment (e.g., rest) within 4-6 weeks, guidelines for managing radiculopathy recommend first evaluating  risks  of  other  possible  causes  that,  although  less  frequent,  require  immediate  diagnosis  and treatment, including infections such as Lyme and shingles. [124]  A history of outdoor activities in likely tick habitats in the last 3 months possibly followed by a rash or viral-like symptoms, and current headache, other symptoms  of  lymphocytic  meningitis,  or  facial  palsy  would  lead  to  suspicion  of  Lyme  disease  and recommendation of serological and lumbar puncture tests for confirmation. [124]\n\nLyme radiculopathy affecting the trunk can be misdiagnosed as myriad other conditions, such as diverticulitis and  acute  coronary  syndrome. [31][105]   Diagnosis  of  late-stage  Lyme  disease  is  often  complicated  by  a multifaceted  appearance  and  nonspecific  symptoms,  prompting  one  reviewer  to  call  Lyme  the  new  \"great imitator\". [125]  As all people with later-stage infection will have a positive antibody test, simple blood tests can exclude Lyme disease as a possible cause of a person's symptoms. [126]"

        "text": "# Treatment\n\nAntibiotics are the primary treatment. [4][15]  The specific approach to their use is dependent on the individual affected and the stage of the disease. [15]  For most people with early localized infection, oral administration of doxycycline is widely recommended as the first choice, as it is effective against not only Borrelia bacteria but also  a  variety  of  other  illnesses  carried  by  ticks. [15]   People  taking  doxycycline  should  avoid  sun  exposure because of higher risk of sunburns. [22]  Doxycycline is contraindicated in children younger than eight years of age and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding; [15]  alternatives to doxycycline are amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil,  and  azithromycin. [15]   Azithromycin  is  recommended  only  in  case  of  intolerance  to  the  other antibiotics. [22]  The standard treatment for cellulitis, cephalexin, is not useful for Lyme disease. [22]  When it is unclear  if  a  rash  is  caused  by  Lyme  or  cellulitis,  the  IDSA  recommends  treatment  with  cefuroxime  or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, as these are effective against both infections. [22] Individuals with early disseminated  or  late  Lyme  infection  may  have  symptomatic  cardiac  disease,  Lyme  arthritis,  or  neurologic symptoms like facial palsy, radiculopathy, meningitis, or peripheral neuropathy. [15] Intravenous administration  of  ceftriaxone  is  recommended  as  the  first  choice  in  these  cases; [15]   cefotaxime  and doxycycline are available as alternatives. [15]\n\nTreatment regimens for Lyme disease range from 7-14 days in early localized disease, to 14-21 days in early disseminated  disease,  to  14-28  days  in  late  disseminated  disease. [42]   Neurologic  complications  of  Lyme disease may be treated with doxycycline as it can be taken by mouth and has a lower cost, although in North America evidence of efficacy is only indirect. [112]  In case of failure, guidelines recommend retreatment with injectable  ceftriaxone. [112]   Several  months  after  treatment  for  Lyme  arthritis,  if  joint  swelling  persists  or returns,  a  second  round  of  antibiotics  may  be  considered;  intravenous  antibiotics  are  preferred  for retreatment in case of poor response to oral antibiotics. [15][22]  Outside of that, a prolonged antibiotic regimen lasting more than 28 days is not recommended, as no evidence shows it to be effective. [15][127]  IgM and IgG antibody  levels  may  be  elevated  for  years  even  after  successful  treatment  with  antibiotics. [15]   As  antibody levels are not indicative of treatment success, testing for them is not recommended. [15]\n\nFacial  palsy  may  resolve  without  treatment;  however,  antibiotic  treatment  is  recommended  to  stop  other Lyme  complications. [22]   Corticosteroids  are  not  recommended  when  facial  palsy  is  caused  by  Lyme disease. [30]  In those with facial palsy, frequent use of artificial tears while awake is recommended, along with ointment and a patch or taping the eye closed when sleeping. [30][128]\n\nAbout  a  third  of  people  with  Lyme  carditis  need  a  temporary  pacemaker  until  their  heart  conduction abnormality  resolves,  and  21%  need  to  be  hospitalized. [33]   Lyme  carditis  should  not  be  treated  with corticosteroids. [33]\n\nPeople with Lyme arthritis should limit their level of physical activity to avoid damaging affected joints, and in case of limping, should use crutches. [129]  Pain associated with Lyme disease may be treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs). [22]   Corticosteroid  joint  injections  are  not  recommended  for  Lyme arthritis  that  is  being  treated  with  antibiotics. [22][129]   People  with  Lyme  arthritis  treated  with  intravenous antibiotics or two months of oral antibiotics who continue to have joint swelling two months after treatment and  have  negative  PCR  test  for Borrelia DNA  in  the  synovial  fluid  are  said  to  have  post-antibiotic  Lyme arthritis; this is more common after infection by certain Borrelia strains in people with certain genetic and immunologic characteristics. [22][42][129]  Post-antibiotic Lyme arthritis may be symptomatically treated with NSAIDs, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), arthroscopic synovectomy, or physical therapy. [42][129]\n\nPeople receiving treatment should be advised that reinfection is possible and how to prevent it. [107]"

        "text": "# Prognosis\n\nLyme disease's typical first sign, the erythema migrans (EM) rash, resolves within several weeks even without treatment. [4]  However, in untreated people, the infection often disseminates to the nervous system, heart or joints, possibly causing permanent damage to body tissues. [22]\n\nPeople who receive recommended antibiotic treatment within several days of the appearance of an initial EM rash have the best prospects. [105]  Recovery may not be total or immediate. The percentage of people achieving full recovery in the United States increases from about 64-71% at the end of treatment for EM rash to about 84-90%  after  30  months;  higher  percentages  are  reported  in  Europe. [130][131]   Treatment  failure,  i.e. persistence of original or appearance of new signs of the disease, occurs only in a few people. [130]  Remaining people are considered cured but continue to experience subjective symptoms, e.g., joint or muscle pains or fatigue. [132]  These symptoms are usually mild and nondisabling. [132]\n\nPeople treated only after nervous system manifestations of the disease may end up with objective neurological deficits,  in  addition  to  subjective  symptoms. [22]   In  Europe,  an  average  of  32-33  months  after  initial  Lyme symptoms in people treated mostly with doxycycline 200 mg for 14-21 days, the percentage of people with lingering symptoms was much higher among those diagnosed with neuroborreliosis (50%) than among those with  only  an  EM  rash  (16%). [133]   In  another  European  study,  5  years  after  treatment  for  neuroborreliosis lingering symptoms were less common among children (15%) than adults (30%), and in the latter were less common among those  treated  within  30  days  of  the  first  symptom  (16%)  than  among  those  treated  later (39%); among those with lingering symptoms, 54% had daily activities restricted and 19% were on sick leave or incapacitated. [134]\n\nSome data suggest that about 90% of Lyme facial palsies treated with antibiotics recover fully a median of 24 days after appearing and most of the rest recover with only mild abnormality. [135][136]  However, in Europe 41%  of  people  treated  for  facial  palsy  had  other  lingering  symptoms  at  followup  up  to  6  months  later, including  28%  with  numbness  or  altered  sensation  and  14%  with  fatigue  or  concentration  problems. [136] Palsies in both sides of the face are associated with worse and longer time to recovery. [135][136]  Historical data suggests that untreated people with facial palsies recover at nearly the same rate, but 88% subsequently have Lyme arthritis. [135][137]  Other research shows that synkinesis (involuntary movement of a facial muscle when another  one  is  voluntarily  moved)  can  become  evident  only  6-12  months  after  facial  palsy  appears  to  be resolved, as damaged nerves regrow and sometimes connect to incorrect muscles. [138]  Synkinesis is associated with corticosteroid use. [138]  In longer-term follow-up, 16-23% of Lyme facial palsies do not fully recover. [138]\n\nIn  Europe,  about  a  quarter  of  people  with  Bannwarth  syndrome  (Lyme  radiculopathy  and  lymphocytic meningitis) treated with intravenous ceftriaxone for 14 days an average of 30 days after first symptoms had to be retreated 3-6 months later because of unsatisfactory clinical response or continued objective markers of infection  in  cerebrospinal  fluid;  after  12  months,  64%  recovered  fully,  31%  had  nondisabling  mild  or infrequent symptoms that did not require regular use of analgesics, and 5% had symptoms that were disabling or  required  substantial  use  of  analgesics. [29]   The  most  common  lingering  nondisabling  symptoms  were headache,  fatigue,  altered  sensation,  joint  pains,  memory  disturbances,  malaise,  radicular  pain,  sleep disturbances,  muscle  pains,  and  concentration  disturbances.  Lingering  disabling  symptoms  included  facial palsy and other impaired movement. [29]\n\nRecovery from late neuroborreliosis tends to take longer and be less complete than from early neuroborreliosis, probably because of irreversible neurologic damage. [22]\n\nAbout  half  the  people  with  Lyme  carditis  progress  to  complete  heart  block,  but  it  usually  resolves  in  a week. [33]   Other  Lyme  heart  conduction  abnormalities  resolve  typically  within  6  weeks. [33]   About  94%  of people have full recovery, but 5% need a permanent pacemaker and 1% end up with persistent heart block (the actual percentage may be higher because of unrecognized cases). [33]  Lyme myocardial complications usually are mild and self-limiting. [33]  However, in some cases Lyme carditis can be fatal. [33]"

        "text": "Recommended antibiotic treatments are effective in about 90% of Lyme arthritis cases, although it can take several  months  for  inflammation  to  resolve  and  a  second  round  of  antibiotics  is  often  necessary. [22] Antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis also eventually resolves, typically within 9-14 months (range 4 months 4 years); DMARDs or synovectomy can accelerate recovery. [129]\n\nReinfection is not uncommon. In a U.S. study, 6-11% of people treated for an EM rash had another EM rash within 30 months. [130]  The second rash typically is due to infection by a different Borrelia strain. [139]\n\n\n# Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome\n\n\n## Symptoms and prevalence\n\nChronic  symptoms  like  pain,  fatigue,  or  cognitive  impairment  are  experienced  by  5-20%  of  people  who contract  Lyme  disease,  even  after  completing  treatment.  This  is  called  Post-treatment  Lyme  disease syndrome, or PTLDS. [13][140]\n\n\n## Causes\n\nThe cause is unknown. [141]  Hypotheses include;\n\n\n- that a persistent, difficult-to-detect infection remains. However, human and animal trials have not provided compelling evidence to support this hypothesis. [142]\n- that the infection triggered autoimmunity. Autoimmune responses are known to occur following other infections, including Campylobacter (Guillain-Barré syndrome), Chlamydia (reactive arthritis), and strep throat (rheumatic heart disease).\n- that debris from a previous infection could remain. [142]\n- that symptoms are unrelated to a Lyme infection. [143][144]  In studies of people who presented to clinics with concerns about Lyme disease, 47 to 80% had no evidence of Lyme infection while 15 to 55% (median 34%) were able to obtain other diagnoses. [142]\n\n\n\n## Risk factors\n\nRisk factors for PTLDS include delayed diagnosis and treatment, incomplete or short-course treatment, and higher severity of initial disease. [141]\n\n\n## Treatment and management\n\nThere is no proven treatment for Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. While short-term antibiotics are effective  in  early  Lyme  disease,  prolonged  antibiotics  are  not.  They  have  been  shown  to  be  ineffective  in placebo-controlled trials and carry the risk of serious, sometimes deadly complications. Generally, treatment is  symptomatic  and  is  similar  to  the  management  of  fibromyalgia  or  ME/CFS.  A  2023  review  found  that PTLDS and ME/CFS had similar pathogenesis despite different infectious origins. [145]\n\n\n## Prognosis\n\nPatients  typically  improve  over  time  without  additional  antibiotics,  but  this  may  take  several  months. [146] There is a lack of long-term data, with few studies of symptoms more than 12 months from initial infection."

        "text": "# Epidemiology and prevalence\n\n\n## Overview\n\nLyme  disease  occurs  regularly  in  Northern  Hemisphere temperate regions. [147]\n\nLyme  disease  effects  are  comparable  among  males  and females.  A  wide  range  of  age  groups  is  affected,  though the number of cases is highest among 10- to 19-year-olds.\n\nAn estimated  476,000  people  a  year  are  diagnosed  and treated for the disease in the United States. This number is  probably  an  overestimate  due  to  overdiagnosis  and  overtreatment. [6][7]   This  number  has  grown  over time. [148]  Over 200,000 people a year are diagnosed and treated in Europe. [8][4][149]\n\n\n## Climate change\n\nClimate change is seen as potentially supportive for ticks. [150][151]  There is a suggestion that tick populations and  Lyme  disease  occurrence  are  increasing  and  spreading  into  new  areas,  owing  in  part  to  the  warming temperatures  of  climate  change. [152]   However,  tick-borne  disease  systems  are  complex,  and  determining whether changes are due to climate change or other drivers can be difficult. [153][154]\n\n\n## North America\n\nMany studies  in  North  America  have  examined  ecological  and  environmental  correlates  of  the  number  of people affected by Lyme disease. A 2005 study using climate suitability modelling of I. scapularis projected that climate change would cause an overall 213% increase in suitable vector habitat by 2080, with northward expansions  in  Canada,  increased  suitability  in  the  central  U.S.,  and  decreased  suitable  habitat  and  vector retraction in the southern U.S. [155]  A 2008 review of published studies concluded that the presence of forests or  forested  areas  was  the  only  variable  that  consistently  elevated  the  risk  of  Lyme  disease  whereas  other environmental variables showed little or no concordance between studies. [156]  The authors argued that the factors  influencing  tick  density  and  human  risk  between  sites  are  still  poorly  understood,  and  that  future studies should be conducted over longer periods, become more standardized across regions, and incorporate existing knowledge of regional Lyme disease ecology. [156]\n\n\n## United States\n\nLyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in North America and Europe, and one of the fastestgrowing infectious diseases in the United States. Of cases reported to the United States CDC, the ratio of Lyme disease  infection  is  7.9  cases  for  every  100,000  persons.  In  the  ten  states  where  Lyme  disease  is  most common, the average was 31.6 cases for every 100,000 persons for the year 2005. [157][158][159]\n\nAlthough Lyme disease has been reported in all states due to travel-associated infections, about 99% of all reported  cases  are  confined  to  just  five  geographic  areas  (New  England,  Mid-Atlantic,  East-North  Central, South Atlantic, and West North-Central). [82][160][161]  CDC implemented national surveillance of Lyme disease cases in 1991. Since then, reporting criteria have been modified multiple times. [162]  The 2022 surveillance case definition  classifies  cases  as  confirmed,  probable,  and  suspect. [163]   The  number  of  reported  cases  of  the disease has been increasing, as are endemic regions in North America.\n\nThe  CDC  emphasizes  that,  while  surveillance  data  have  limitations,  they  are  useful  due  to  \"uniformity, simplicity, and timeliness.\" While cases are under-reported in high-incidence areas, over-reporting is likely in low-incidence areas. Additionally, surveillance cases are reported by the county of residence and not where an infection was necessarily contracted. [164][82]"

        "text": "Several similar but distinct conditions may exist, caused by  various  species  or  subspecies  of Borrelia in  North America.  A  regionally  restricted  condition  that  may  be related  to Borrelia infection  is  southern  tick-associated rash  illness  (STARI),  also  known  as  Masters  disease. Amblyomma  americanum ,  known  commonly  as  the lone-star  tick,  is  recognized  as  the  primary  vector  for STARI. In some parts of the geographical distribution of STARI,  Lyme  disease  is  quite  rare  (e.g.,  Arkansas),  so people in these regions experiencing Lyme-like symptoms-especially  if  they  follow  a  bite  from  a  lonestar  tick-should  consider  STARI  as  a  possibility.  It  is generally  a  milder  condition  than  Lyme  and  typically responds well to antibiotic treatment. [165]\n\nIn recent years, there have been 5 to 10 cases a year of a disease similar to Lyme occurring in Montana. It occurs primarily  in  pockets  along  the  Yellowstone  River  in\n\nNational Lyme disease risk map wvith four categories of risk\n\nCDC map showing the risk of Lyme disease in the United States, particularly its concentration in the Northeast Megalopolis and western Wisconsin (2004)\n\ncentral Montana. People have developed a red bull's-eye rash around a tick bite, followed by weeks of fatigue and a fever. [161]\n\n\n## Canada\n\nThe range of ticks capable of carrying Lyme disease has expanded from a limited area of Ontario to include areas of southern Quebec, Manitoba, northern Ontario, southern New Brunswick, southwest Nova Scotia and limited parts of Saskatchewan and Alberta, as well as British Columbia. Cases have been reported as far east as the island of Newfoundland. [104][166][167][168]  A model-based prediction by Leighton et al. (2012) suggests that  the  range  of  the I.  scapularis tick  will  expand  into  Canada  by  46  km/year  over  the  next  decade,  with warming climatic temperatures as the main driver of increased speed of spread. [169]\n\n\n## Europe\n\nIn  Europe,  Lyme disease is  caused  by  infection  with  one  or  more  pathogenic  European  genospecies  of  the spirochaete B.  burgdorferi  sensu  lato ,  mainly  transmitted  by  the  tick Ixodes  ricinus . [170]   Cases  of B. burgdorferi sensu lato -infected ticks are found predominantly in central Europe, particularly in Slovenia and Austria, but have been isolated in almost every country on the continent. [171]  The number of cases in southern Europe, such as Italy and Portugal, is much lower. [172]  Diagnosed cases in some Western countries, such as Iceland, are rising. [173]  Lyme disease is rare in Iceland. On average, around 6 to 7 cases are diagnosed every year,  primarily  localised  infections  presenting  as  erythema  migrans.  None  of  the  cases  had  a  definitive Icelandic origin and the yearly number of cases has not been increasing. [174]\n\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nIn the United Kingdom the number of laboratory-confirmed cases of Lyme disease has been rising steadily since  voluntary  reporting  was  introduced  in  1986 [175]   when  68  cases  were  recorded  in  the  UK  and  Ireland combined. [176]  In the UK there were 23 confirmed cases in 1988 and 19 in 1990, [177]  but 973 in 2009 [175]  and 953 in 2010. [178]  Provisional figures for the first 3 quarters of 2011 show a 26% increase on the same period in 2010. [179]\n\nIt  is  thought,  however,  that  the  actual  number  of  cases  is  significantly  higher  than  suggested  by  the  above figures, with England's Health Protection Agency estimating that there are between 2,000 and 3,000 cases in England  and  Wales  per  year [178]   (with  an  average  of  around  15%  of  the  infections  acquired  overseas [175] ), while  Dr  Darrel  Ho-Yen,  Director  of  the  Scottish  Toxoplasma  Reference  Laboratory  and  National  Lyme Disease  Testing  Service,  believes  that  the  number  of  confirmed  cases  should  be  multiplied  by  10  \"to  take account of wrongly diagnosed cases, tests giving false results, sufferers who weren't tested, people who are infected  but  not  showing  symptoms,  failures  to  notify  and  infected  individuals  who  don't  consult  a doctor.\" [180][181]"

        "text": "Lyme  disease  is  a  notifiable  disease  in  Scotland. [182][183]   Mandatory  reporting,  limited  to  laboratory  test results only, is required in the UK under the provisions of the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010. [175]\n\nAlthough there is a greater number of cases of Lyme disease in the New Forest, Salisbury Plain, Exmoor, the South  Downs,  parts  of  Wiltshire  and  Berkshire,  Thetford  Forest [184]   and  the  West  coast  and  islands  of Scotland, [185]   infected  ticks  are  widespread and can even be found in the parks of London. [177][186]  A 1989 report found that 25% of forestry workers in the New Forest were seropositive, as were between 2% and 4-5% of the general local population of the area. [187][188]\n\nTests on pet dogs carried out throughout the country in 2009 indicated that around 2.5% of ticks in the UK may be infected, considerably higher than previously thought. [189][190]  It is speculated that global warming may lead to an increase in tick activity in the future, as well as an increase in the amount of time that people spend in public parks, thus increasing the risk of infection. [191]  However, no published research has proven this to be so.\n\n\n## South America\n\nIn  Brazil,  Lyme  disease  is  not  considered  endemic. [192]   A  Lyme-like  disease  known  as  Baggio-Yoshinari syndrome has been described, attributed to microorganisms that do not belong to the B. burgdorferi sensu lato complex and transmitted by ticks of the Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus genera. [193]   The first reported case of BYS in Brazil was made in 1992 in Cotia, São Paulo. [194]  A 2024 analysis concluded that evidence to connect BYS to Borrelia bacteria was lacking. [192]\n\n\n## Mexico\n\nA  2007  study  suggests Borrelia  burgdorferi infections  are  endemic  to  Mexico,  with  four  cases  reported between 1999 and 2000. [195]\n\n\n## Africa\n\nIn northern  Africa, B.  burgdorferi  sensu  lato has been  identified  in  Morocco,  Algeria,  Egypt  and Tunisia. [196][197][198]\n\nLyme disease in sub-Saharan Africa is presently unknown, but evidence indicates it may occur in humans in this  region.  The  abundance  of  hosts  and  tick  vectors  would  favor  the  establishment  of  Lyme  infection  in Africa. [199]   In  East  Africa,  two  cases  of  Lyme  disease  have  been  reported  in  Kenya. [200]   According  The Federation of Infectious Diseases Societies of Southern Africa, Lyme disease is not known to be endemic in either South Africa or Mozambique. [201]\n\n\n## Asia\n\nB.  burgdorferi sensu lato -infested ticks  are  being  found  more  frequently  in  Japan,  as  well  as  in  northwest China, Nepal, Thailand and far eastern Russia. [202][203] Borrelia has also been isolated in Mongolia. [204]\n\n\n## Australia\n\nLyme disease is not considered endemic to Australia. [205]  While there have been reports of people acquiring Lyme disease in Australia,  and  even  evidence  of  closely  related Borrelia species  in  ticks, [206]   the  evidence linking these cases to local transmission is limited. Ongoing research on resolving potential Borrelia species to Debilitating Symptom Complexes Attributed to Ticks (DSCATT) in Australia is ongoing. [207]"

        "text": "# Prevention\n\nTick bites can be prevented by avoiding or reducing time in likely tick habitats and taking precautions while in and when getting out of one. [208][9]\n\nMost Lyme human infections are caused by Ixodes nymph bites between April and September. [15][208]  Ticks prefer  moist,  shaded  locations  in  woodlands,  shrubs,  tall  grasses  and  leaf  litter  or  wood  piles. [15][209]   Tick densities tend to be highest in woodlands, followed by unmaintained edges between woods and lawns (about half  as  high),  ornamental  plants  and  perennial  groundcover  (about  a  quarter),  and  lawns  (about  30  times less). [210]  Ixodes larvae and nymphs tend to be abundant also where mice nest, such as stone walls and wood logs. [210]  Ixodes larvae and nymphs typically wait for potential hosts (\"quest\") on leaves or grasses close to the ground with forelegs outstretched; when a host brushes against its limbs, the tick rapidly clings and climbs on the host looking for a skin location to bite. [211]  In Northeastern United States, 69% of tick bites are estimated to happen in residences, 11% in schools or camps, 9% in parks or recreational areas, 4% at work, 3% while hunting, and 4% in other areas. [210]  Activities associated with tick bites around residences include yard work, brush clearing, gardening, playing in the yard, and letting dogs or cats that roam outside in woody or grassy areas into the house. [210][208]  In parks, tick bites often happen while hiking or camping. [210]  Walking on a mown lawn or center of a trail without touching adjacent vegetation is less risky than crawling or sitting on a log or stone wall. [210][212]  Pets should not be allowed to roam freely in likely tick habitats. [209]\n\nAs  a  precaution,  CDC  recommends  soaking  or  spraying  clothes,  shoes,  and  camping  gear  such  as  tents, backpacks  and  sleeping  bags  with  0.5%  permethrin  solution  and  hanging  them  to  dry  before  use. [208][213] Permethrin is odorless and safe for humans but highly toxic to ticks. [214]  After crawling on permethrin-treated fabric  for  as  few  as  10-20  seconds,  tick  nymphs  become  irritated  and  fall  off  or  die. [214][215]   Permethrintreated  closed-toed  shoes  and  socks  reduce  by  74  times  the  number  of  bites  from  nymphs  that  make  first contact with a shoe of a person also wearing treated shorts (because nymphs usually quest near the ground, this  is  a  typical  contact  scenario). [214]   Better  protection  can  be  achieved  by  tucking  permethrin-treated trousers (pants) into treated socks and a treated long-sleeve shirt into the trousers so as to minimize gaps through which a tick might reach the wearer's skin. [212]  Light-colored clothing may make it easier to see ticks and remove them before they bite. [212]  Military and outdoor workers' uniforms treated with permethrin have been found to reduce the number of bite cases by 80-95%. [215]  Permethrin protection lasts several weeks of wear and washings in customer-treated items and up to 70 washings for factory-treated items. [213]  Permethrin should not be used on human skin, underwear or cats. [213][216]\n\nThe EPA recommends several tick repellents for use on exposed skin, including DEET, picaridin, IR3535 (a derivative of amino acid beta-alanine), oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE, a natural compound) and OLE's active ingredient para-menthane-diol (PMD). [208][217][218]  Unlike permethrin, repellents repel but do not kill ticks, protect  for  only  several  hours  after  application,  and  may  be  washed  off  by  sweat  or  water. [213]   The  most popular repellent is DEET in the U.S. and picaridin in Europe. [218]  Unlike DEET, picaridin is odorless and is less  likely  to  irritate  the  skin  or  harm  fabric  or  plastics. [218]   Repellents  with  higher  concentration  may last longer but are not more effective; against ticks, 20% picaridin may work for 8 hours vs. 55-98.11% DEET for 5-6 hours or 30-40% OLE for 6 hours. [213][217]  Repellents should not be used under clothes, on eyes, mouth, wounds or cuts, or on babies younger than 2 months (3 years for OLE or PMD). [213][208]  If sunscreen is used, repellent should be applied on top of it. [213]  Repellents should not be sprayed directly on a face, but should instead be sprayed on a hand and then rubbed on the face. [213]\n\nAfter coming indoors, clothes, gear and pets should be checked for ticks. [208]  Clothes can be put into a hot dryer for 10 minutes to kill ticks (just washing or a warm dryer is not enough). [208]  Showering as soon as possible, looking for ticks over the entire body, and removing them reduces the risk of infection. [208]  Unfed tick nymphs are the size of a poppy seed, but a day or two after biting and attaching themselves to a person, they look like a small blood blister. [219]  The following areas should be checked especially carefully: armpits, between legs, back of knee, bellybutton, trunk, and in children ears, neck and hair. [208]"

        "text": "# Tick removal\n\nAttached  ticks  should  be  removed  promptly.  The  risk  of  infection increases with the time of attachment. In North America, the risk of Lyme disease is small if the tick is removed within 36 hours. [220]  CDC recommends inserting a fine-tipped tweezer between the skin and the tick, grasping very firmly, and pulling the closed tweezer straight away from  the  skin  without  twisting,  jerking,  squeezing  or  crushing  the tick. [221]   After  tick  removal,  any  tick  parts  remaining  in  the  skin should be removed with a clean tweezer, if possible. [221]  The wound and hands should then be cleaned with alcohol or soap and water. [221] The tick may be disposed of by placing it in a container with alcohol, a\n\nsealed bag, tape, or flushing it down the toilet. [221]  The bitten person should write down where and when the bite  happened  so  that  this  information  can  be  provided  to  a  doctor  if  the  person  gets  a  rash  or  flu-like symptoms in the following several weeks. [221]  CDC recommends not using fingers, nail polish, petroleum jelly or heat on the tick to try to remove it. [221]\n\nIn Australia, where the Australian paralysis tick is prevalent, the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy recommends not using tweezers to remove ticks, because if the person is allergic, anaphylaxis could result. [222]  Instead, a product should be sprayed on the tick to cause it to freeze and then drop off. [222] Another method consists in using about 20 cm (8 inches) of dental floss or fishing line for slowly tying an overhand knot between the skin and the tick and then pulling it away from the skin. [223][224]\n\n\n## Preventive antibiotics\n\nThe risk of infectious transmission increases with the duration of tick attachment. [15]  It requires between 36 and 48 hours of attachment for the bacteria that cause Lyme to travel from within the tick into its saliva. [15]  If a deer tick that is sufficiently likely to be carrying Borrelia is found attached to a person and removed, and if the tick has been attached for 36 hours or is engorged, a single dose of doxycycline administered within the 72 hours  after  removal  may  reduce  the  risk  of  Lyme  disease.  It  is  not  generally  recommended  for  all  people bitten, as development of infection is rare: about 50 bitten people would have to be treated this way to prevent one case of erythema migrans (i.e., the typical rash found in about 70-80% of people infected). [4][15]\n\n\n## Garden landscaping\n\nSeveral  landscaping  practices  may  reduce  the  risk  of  tick  bites  in  residential  yards. [219][225]   These  include keeping lawns mown, removing leaf litter and weeds and avoiding the use of ground cover. [219]  A 3-ft-wide rock  or  woodchip  barrier  is  recommended  to  separate  lawns  from  wood  piles,  woodlands,  stone  walls  and shrubs. [225]  Without vegetation on the barrier, ticks will tend not to cross it; acaricides may also be sprayed on it  to  kill  ticks. [225]   A  sun-exposed  tick-safe  zone  at  least  9  ft  from  the  barrier  should  concentrate  human activity on the yard, including any patios, playgrounds and gardening. [225]  Materials such as wood decking, concrete,  bricks,  gravel  or  woodchips  used  on  the  ground  under  patios  and  playgrounds  would  discourage ticks there. [219]  An 8-ft-high fence may be added to keep deer away from the tick-safe zone. [225][219]\n\n\n## Occupational exposure\n\nOutdoor  workers  are  at  risk  of  Lyme  disease  if  they  work  at  sites  with  infected  ticks.  This  includes construction,  landscaping,  forestry,  brush  clearing,  land  surveying,  farming,  railroad  work,  oil  field  work, utility  line  work,  park or wildlife management. [226][227]  U.S. workers in the northeastern and north-central states are at highest risk of exposure to infected ticks. Ticks may also transmit other tick-borne diseases to workers in these and other regions of the country. Worksites with woods, bushes, high grass or leaf litter are likely to have more ticks. Outdoor workers should be most careful to protect themselves in the late spring and summer when young ticks are most active. [228]"

        "text": "# Host animals\n\nTicks can feed upon the blood of a wide array of possible host species, including lizards, birds, mice, cats, dogs, deer, cattle and humans. The extent to which a tick can feed, reproduce, and spread will depend on the type and availability of its hosts. Whether it will spread disease is also affected by its available hosts. Some species, such as lizards, are referred to as \"dilution hosts\" because they don't tend to support Lyme disease pathogens and decrease the likelihood that the disease will be passed on by ticks feeding on them. Whitetailed deer are both a food source and a \"reproductive host\", where ticks tend to mate. [229]  The white-footed mouse is a reservoir host in which the pathogen for Lyme disease can survive. The availability of hosts can have significant impacts on the transmission of Lyme disease. A greater diversity of hosts, or of those that don't support the pathogen, tends to decrease the likelihood that the disease will be transmitted. [153]\n\nIn the United States, one approach to reducing the incidence of Lyme and other deer tick-borne diseases has been  to  greatly  reduce  the  deer  population  on  which  the  adult  ticks  depend  for  feeding  and  reproduction. Lyme disease cases fell following deer eradication on an island, Monhegan, Maine, [230]  and following deer control in Mumford Cove, Connecticut. [231]  Advocates have suggested reducing the deer population to levels of  8  to  10  deer  per  square mile, compared to levels of 60 or more deer per square mile in the areas of the country with the highest Lyme disease rates. [232]  While these studies have found these effects, other studies have  found  opposite  effects.  A  study  done  in  Massachusetts  removed  deer  and  did  not  see  a  significant decrease in tick abundance afterwards. [233]  Another study done in New Jersey removed deer and also did not see a reduction in the number of questing ticks and determined that deer culling is an unlikely way to control tick  populations  effectively. [234]   One  study  summarized  the  results  of  multiple  studies  all  looking  at  deer reduction  controlling  tick  populations  and  determined  that  deer  control  can't  be  used  as  a  standalone reduction for Lyme disease. It also claims that most studies examining this are not representative of areas with high human Lyme disease risk. [235]  There is varying information on whether or not the removal of deer is actually a way to control the Lyme disease epidemic. Removal of smaller mammals that are fed on by juveniles who are more actively acquiring and spreading the pathogen would decrease Lyme disease risk the most. [236]\n\nOthers have noted that while deer are reproductive hosts, they are not Borrelia burgdorferi reservoirs. This is because  it  was  found  that  white-tailed  deer  blood  actually  kills  the Borrelia  burgdorferi bacteria. [237] Researchers have suggested that smaller, less obviously visible Lyme reservoirs, like white-footed mice and Eastern chipmunks, may more strongly impact Lyme disease occurrence. Ecosystem studies in New York state suggest that white-footed mice thrive when forests are broken into smaller, isolated chunks of woodland with fewer rodent predators. With more rodents harboring the disease, the odds increase that a tick will feed on a disease-harboring  rodent  and  that  someone  will  pick  up  a  disease-carrying  tick  in  their  garden  or  while walking in the woods. Data indicates that the smaller the wooded area, the more ticks it will contain and the likely they are to carry Lyme disease, supporting the idea that deforestation and habitat fragmentation affect ticks, hosts and disease transmission. [153]\n\nTick-borne diseases are estimated to affect ~80  % of  cattle  worldwide. [238]   They  also  affect  cats,  dogs,  and other  pets.  Routine  veterinary  control  of  ticks  of  domestic  animals  through  the  use  of  acaricides  has  been suggested as a way to reduce exposure of humans to ticks. However, chemical control with acaricides is now criticized on several grounds. Ticks appear to develop resistance to acaricides; acaricides are costly; and there are concerns over their toxicity and the potential for chemical residues to affect food and the environment. [239]\n\nIn Europe, known reservoirs of Borrelia burgdorferi were 9 small mammals, 7 medium-sized mammals and 16  species  of  birds  (including  passerines,  sea-birds  and  pheasants). [240]   These  animals  seem  to  transmit spirochetes  to  ticks  and  thus  participate  in  the  natural  circulation  of  B.  burgdorferi  in  Europe.  The  house mouse  is  also  suspected  as  well  as  other  species  of  small  rodents,  particularly  in  Eastern  Europe  and Russia. [240]   \"The  reservoir  species  that  contain  the  most  pathogens  are  the  European  roe  deer Capreolus capreolus ; [241]   \" it  does  not  appear to serve as a major reservoir of B. burgdorferi \"  thought Jaenson & al. (1992) [242]  (incompetent host for B. burgdorferi and TBE virus) but it is important for feeding the ticks, [243]"

[244]   Nevertheless,  in  the  2000s,  in  roe  deer  in Europe \" two species of Rickettsia and two species of Borrelia were identified \". [241]\n\n\n# Vaccination\n\nAs of 2023, no human vaccines for Lyme disease were available. [14]  The only human vaccine to advance to market was LYMErix, which was available from 1998, but discontinued in 2002. [245]  The vaccine candidate VLA15  was  scheduled  to  start  a  phase  3  trial  in  the  third  quarter  of  2022,  with  other  research  ongoing. Multiple vaccines are available for the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs.\n\n\n## LYMErix\n\nThe vaccine LYMErix was available from 1998 to 2002. The recombinant vaccine against Lyme disease, based on the outer surface protein A (OspA) of B. burgdorferi with aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant, was developed by SmithKline Beecham. In clinical trials involving more than 10,000 people, the vaccine was found to confer protective  immunity  to  Lyme  disease  in  76%  of  adults  after  three  doses  with  only  mild  or  moderate  and transient adverse effects. [246][247]  On 21 December 1998, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved LYMErix based on these trials for persons of ages 15 through 70. [247][245]\n\nFollowing approval of the vaccine, its entry into clinical practice was slow for a variety of reasons, including its cost,  which  was  often  not  reimbursed  by  insurance  companies. [248]   Subsequently,  hundreds  of  vaccine recipients  reported  they  had  developed  autoimmune  and  other  side  effects.  Supported  by  some  advocacy groups, a number of class-action lawsuits were filed against GlaxoSmithKline, alleging the vaccine had caused these health problems. These claims were investigated by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control, which found no connection between the vaccine and the autoimmune complaints. [249]\n\nDespite the lack of evidence that the complaints were caused by the vaccine, sales plummeted and LYMErix was withdrawn from the U.S. market by GlaxoSmithKline in February 2002, [250]  in the setting of negative media coverage and fears of vaccine side effects. [249][251]  The fate of LYMErix was described in the medical literature as a \"cautionary tale\"; [251]  an editorial in Nature cited the withdrawal of LYMErix as an instance in which  \"unfounded  public  fears  place  pressures  on  vaccine  developers  that  go  beyond  reasonable  safety considerations.\" [252]   The  original  developer  of  the  OspA  vaccine  at  the  Max  Planck  Institute  told Nature : \"This  just  shows  how  irrational  the  world  can  be  ...  There  was  no  scientific  justification  for  the  first  OspA vaccine LYMErix being pulled.\" [249][253]\n\n\n## VLA15\n\nThe  hexavalent  (OspA)  protein  subunit-based  vaccine  candidate  VLA15  was  developed  by  Valneva.  It  was granted fast track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July 2017. [254][255]  In April 2020 Pfizer  paid  $130  million  for  the  rights  to  the  vaccine,  and  the  companies  are  developing  it  together, performing multiple phase 2 trials. [256]\n\nA phase 3 trial of VLA15 was scheduled for late 2022, recruiting volunteers at test sites located across the northeastern United States and in Europe. [257][258]   Participants  were  scheduled  to  receive  an  initial  threedose series of vaccines over the course of five to nine months, followed by a booster dose after twelve months, with both the initial series and the booster dose scheduled to be complete before the year's peak Lyme disease season. [258]\n\n\n## Other research\n\nAn mRNA vaccine designed to cause a strong, fast immune response to tick saliva allowed the immune system to detect and remove the ticks from test animals before they were able to transmit the infectious bacteria. [259] The  vaccine  contains  mRNAs  for  the  body  to  build  19  proteins  in  tick  saliva  which,  by  enabling  quick development of erythema (itchy redness) at the bite site, protects guinea pigs against Lyme disease. It also protects the test animals if the tick is not removed, if only one tick, but not three, remains attached. [260][261]"

        "text": "Sanofi, in cooperation with the Choumet Group and the Pardi lab, also developed and evaluated new mRNA vaccine candidates targeting the bacterium's outer surface protein A (OspA), delivered via lipid nanoparticles. In mouse models, the mRNA-OspA vaccine elicited robust immune responses and offered complete protection against infection-outperforming traditional protein-based vaccines. The findings suggest that mRNA-OspA vaccines hold promise for preventing Lyme disease in humans. [262][263]\n\n\n# Canine vaccines\n\nCanine vaccines have been formulated and approved for the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs. Currently, three Lyme disease vaccines are available. LymeVax, formulated by Fort Dodge Laboratories, contains intact dead spirochetes, which expose the host to the organism. Galaxy Lyme, Intervet-Schering-Plough's vaccine, targets proteins OspC and OspA. The OspC antibodies kill any of the bacteria that the OspA antibodies did not kill.  Canine  Recombinant Lyme, formulated by Merial, generates antibodies against the OspA protein, so a tick feeding on a vaccinated dog draws in blood full of anti-OspA antibodies, which kill the spirochetes in the tick's gut before they are transmitted to the dog. [264]\n\n\n## Etymology\n\nLyme disease was diagnosed as a separate condition for the first time in 1975 in Lyme, Connecticut. [265]\n\n\n## History\n\n\n## Early evidence\n\nThe earliest known evidence of Lyme disease was found in Oetzi, a 5300 year old mummy in the Eastern Alps near the Italian border. [266]  The evolutionary history of Borrelia burgdorferi genetics has been examined by scientists. One  study has found that before the reforestation that accompanied  post-colonial  farm abandonment in New England and the wholesale migration into the Midwest that occurred during the early 19th century, Lyme disease had been present for thousands of years in America and had spread along with its tick hosts from the Northeast to the Midwest. [267]\n\nJohn  Josselyn,  who  visited  New  England  in  1638  and  again  from  1663  to  1670,  wrote,  \"There  be  infinite numbers of ticks hanging upon the bushes in summertime that will cleave to man's garments and creep into his breeches, eating themselves in a short time into the very flesh of a man. I have seen the stockings of those that have gone through the woods covered with them.\" [268]\n\nThis is also confirmed by the writings of Peter Kalm, a Swedish botanist who was sent to America by Linnaeus, and who found the forests of New York \"abound\" with ticks when he visited in 1749. When Kalm's journey was retraced 100 years later, the forests were gone and the Lyme bacterium had probably become isolated to a few pockets along the northeast coast, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. [269]\n\nPerhaps the first detailed description of what is now known as Lyme disease appeared in the writings of John Walker after a visit to the island of Jura (Deer Island) off the west coast of Scotland in 1764. [270]  He gives a good description both of the symptoms of Lyme disease (with \"exquisite pain [in] the interior parts of the limbs\") and of the tick vector itself, which he describes as a \"worm\" with a body which is \"of a reddish color and of a compressed shape with a row of feet on each side\" that \"penetrates the skin\". Many people from this area of Great Britain emigrated to North America between 1717 and the end of the 18th century. [271]"

        "text": "The examination of preserved museum specimens has found Borrelia DNA in an infected Ixodes ricinus tick from Germany dating back to 1884, and an infected mouse from Cape Cod that died in 1894. [269]  The 2010 autopsy of Ötzi the Iceman, a 5,300-year-old mummy, revealed the presence of ~60% of the DNA sequence of Borrelia burgdorferi . [272][273]\n\nThe early European studies of what is now known as Lyme disease described its skin manifestations. The first study dates to 1883 in Breslau, Germany (now Wrocław, Poland), where physician Alfred Buchwald described a  man  who  for  16  years  had  had  a  degenerative  skin  disorder  now  known  as  acrodermatitis  chronica atrophicans. [274]\n\nAt a 1909 research conference, Swedish dermatologist Arvid Afzelius presented a study about an expanding, ring-like lesion he had observed in an older woman following the bite of a sheep tick. He named the lesion erythema  migrans . [274]   The  skin  condition  now  known  as  borrelial  lymphocytoma  was  first  described  in 1911. [275]\n\n\n## 1950-1970\n\nNeurological problems following tick bites have been recognized since the 1920s. French physicians Garin and Bujadoux described a farmer with a painful sensory radiculitis accompanied by mild meningitis following a tick bite. A  large, ring-shaped  rash  was  also  noted,  although  the  doctors  did  not  relate  it  to  the meningoradiculitis. In 1930, the Swedish dermatologist Sven Hellerström was the first to propose that EM and neurological symptoms following a tick bite were related. [276]  In the 1940s, German neurologist Alfred Bannwarth described several cases of chronic lymphocytic meningitis and polyradiculoneuritis, some of which were accompanied by erythematous skin lesions.\n\nCarl  Lennhoff,  who  worked  at  the  Karolinska  Institute  in  Sweden,  believed  spirochetes  caused  many  skin conditions. In 1948, he published on his use of a special stain to microscopically observe what he believed were  spirochetes  in  various  types  of  skin  lesions,  including  EM. [277]   Starting  in  1946,  facilities  in  Sweden experimented  with  treating  EM  rashes  with  substances  known  to  kill  spirochetes. [278]   Einar  Hollström reported that \"penicillin was found to be the most effective.\" [279]  In 1949, Nils Thyresson, who also worked at the Karolinska Institute, was the first to treat ACA with penicillin. [280]  In the 1950s, the relationship among tick bite, lymphocytoma, EM and Bannwarth's syndrome was recognized throughout Europe, leading to the widespread use of penicillin for treatment in Europe. [281][282]\n\nIn 1970, a dermatologist in Wisconsin named Rudolph Scrimenti recognized an EM lesion in a person after recalling a paper by Hellerström that had been reprinted in an American science journal in 1950. This was the first  documented case of EM in the United States. Based on the European literature, he treated the person with penicillin. [283]\n\n\n## From 1970\n\nBefore  1976,  the  elements  of B.  burgdorferi  sensu  lato infection  were  called  or  known  as  tick-borne meningopolyneuritis,  Garin-Bujadoux  syndrome,  Bannwarth  syndrome,  Afzelius's  disease, [284]   Montauk Knee or sheep tick fever. Since 1976, the disease has been most often referred to as Lyme disease, [285][286] Lyme borreliosis, or simply borreliosis. [287][288]\n\nThe full syndrome now known as Lyme disease was not recognized until a cluster of cases originally thought to be  juvenile  rheumatoid  arthritis [289]   was  identified  in  three  towns  in  southeastern  Connecticut  in  1975, including the towns Lyme and Old Lyme, which gave the disease its popular name. [290]  This was investigated by physicians David Snydman and Allen Steere of the Epidemic Intelligence Service, and by others from Yale University, including Stephen Malawista, who is credited as a co-discover of the disease. [291]  The recognition that the people in the United States had EM led to the recognition that \"Lyme arthritis\" was one manifestation of the same tick-borne condition known in Europe. [292]"

        "text": "In 1980, Steere, et al. ,  began to test antibiotic regimens in adults with Lyme disease. [293]  In the same year, New York State  Health  Dept.  epidemiologist  Jorge  Benach  provided  Willy  Burgdorfer,  a  researcher  at  the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory, with collections of I. dammini [ scapularis ] from Shelter Island, New York, a known Lyme-endemic area as part of an ongoing investigation of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. In examining  the  ticks  for  rickettsiae,  Burgdorfer  noticed  \"poorly  stained,  rather  long,  irregularly  coiled spirochetes.\" Further examination revealed spirochetes in 60% of the ticks. Burgdorfer credited his familiarity with the European literature for his realization that the spirochetes might be the \"long-sought cause of ECM and Lyme disease.\" Benach supplied him with more ticks from Shelter Island and sera from people diagnosed with Lyme disease. University of Texas Health Science Center researcher Alan Barbour \"offered his expertise to  culture  and  immunochemically  characterize  the  organism.\"  Burgdorfer  subsequently  confirmed  his discovery by isolating spirochetes identical to those found in ticks from people with Lyme disease. [294]  In June 1982,  he  published  his  findings  in  Science,  and  the  spirochete  was  named Borrelia  burgdorferi in  his honor. [295][296]\n\nAfter the identification of B. burgdorferi as the causative agent of Lyme disease, antibiotics were selected for testing,  guided  by in  vitro antibiotic  sensitivities,  including  tetracycline  antibiotics,  amoxicillin,  cefuroxime axetil, intravenous and intramuscular penicillin and intravenous ceftriaxone. [297][298]  The mechanism of tick transmission was also the subject of much discussion. B. burgdorferi spirochetes were identified in tick saliva in 1987, confirming the hypothesis that transmission occurred via tick salivary glands. [299]\n\n\n# Society, culture, and controversy\n\n\n## Landscape changes and urbanization\n\nUrbanization and other anthropogenic factors can be implicated in the spread of Lyme disease to humans. In many areas, the expansion of suburban neighborhoods has led to the gradual deforestation of surrounding wooded areas and increased border contact between humans and tick-dense areas. Human expansion has also resulted in a reduction of predators that hunt deer as well as mice, chipmunks and other small rodents-the primary reservoirs for Lyme disease. As a consequence of increased human contact with host and vector, the likelihood of transmission of the disease has greatly increased. [300][301]  Researchers are investigating possible links between global warming and the spread of vector-borne diseases, including Lyme disease. [302]\n\n\n## The dilution effect\n\nGiven  these  habitat-host  dynamics,  in  2003,  some  researchers  began  to  postulate  whether  the  so-called dilution effect could mitigate the spread of Lyme disease. [300]  The dilution effect is a hypothesis that predicts that  an  increase  in  host  biodiversity  will  result  in  a  decrease  in  the  number  of  vectors  infected  with B. burgdorferi . [300]   Scientific  research  has  shown  that  nymphal  infection  prevalence  (NIP)  decreases  as  the number of host species increases, supporting the dilution effect. [300]  That said, there is no direct relationship between decreased NIP and decreased epidemiological risk, as this has yet to be proven. [300]  Additionally, as of 2018, the dilution effect is only supported in the Northeastern United States, and has been disproved in other parts of the world that also experience high Lyme disease incidence rates  [303]\n\n\n## Chronic Lyme disease\n\nThe term \"chronic Lyme disease\" is controversial and not recognized in the medical literature, [304]  and most medical authorities advise against long-term antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease. [22][112][305]  Studies have shown that most people diagnosed with \"chronic Lyme disease\" either have no objective evidence of previous or current infection with B. burgdorferi or are people who should be classified as having post-treatment Lyme disease  syndrome  (PTLDS),  which  is  defined  as  continuing  or  relapsing  non-specific  symptoms  (such  as fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and cognitive complaints) in a person previously treated for Lyme disease.

[308]  A 2004 book entitled Lab 257: The Disturbing Story of the Government's Secret Plum Island Germ Laboratory fueled the conspiracy theories.

Kennedy Jr. [312]\n\n\n## Other animals\n\n\n## Dogs\n\nPrevention of Lyme disease is an important step in keeping dogs safe in endemic areas. Prevention education and a number of preventive measures are available. First, for dog owners who live near or visit tick-infested areas, routine vaccinations of their dogs are an important step. [313]\n\nAnother crucial preventive measure is the use of persistent acaricides, such as topical repellents or pesticides that contain triazapentadienes (Amitraz), phenylpyrazoles (Fipronil), or permethrin (pyrethroids). [314]  These acaricides target primarily the adult stages of Lyme-carrying ticks and reduce the number of reproductively active  ticks  in  the  environment. [313]   Formulations  of  these  ingredients  are  available  in  a  variety  of  topical forms, including spot-ons, sprays, powders, impregnated collars, solutions, and shampoos. [314]\n\nExamining a dog for ticks after visiting a tick-infested area is an important precautionary measure to prevent Lyme disease. Key spots to examine include the head, neck, and ears. [315]\n\nIn dogs, a serious long-term prognosis may result in glomerular disease, [316]  a category of kidney damage that may cause chronic kidney disease. [264]  Dogs may also experience chronic joint disease if the disease is left untreated.  However,  the  majority  of  cases  of  Lyme  disease  in  dogs  result  in  complete  recovery  with,  and sometimes without, treatment with antibiotics. [317]  In rare cases, Lyme disease can be fatal to both humans and dogs. [318]\n\n\n## Cats\n\nUnlike dogs, it is unusual for a cat to be infected with Lyme disease. However, cats are nevertheless capable of being infected with B. burgdorferi , following a bite from an infected tick. Cats infected with Lyme Disease may show symptoms including, but not limited to, lameness, fatigue, or loss of appetite. [319]  In two cases, the infected cats experienced cardiac irregularities similar to symptoms of Lyme in both dogs and humans. [320] However, cats who are infected with Lyme disease are likely to be asymptomatic, and show no noticeable signs of the disease. [320][319]  Cats with Lyme are often treated with antibiotics, much like other animals. In some cases, additional treatment or therapy may be required. [319]\n\n\n## Horses\n\nLyme  disease  in  horses  is  challenging  to  diagnose  due  to  variable  symptoms.  Common  acute  symptoms include weight loss, fever, lameness, ataxia, and other muscle and joint-related issues. [321][322][323]  Additional symptoms  include  muscle  tenderness,  swollen  joints,  arthritis,  and  neck  stiffness. [324][325][326]   Chronic symptoms of the disease typically include neurological manifestations, such as meningitis, cranial neuritis, radiculoneuritis, and  encephalitis. [b] Furthermore,  some  horses  do  not  slow  clinical  signs  of  Lyme disease. [330]"

        "text": "There  are  three  main  testing  strategies  used  to  diagnose  horses  with  Lyme  disease.  They  include  clinical evaluation, serological testing, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. [331][332][322]  Detection of specific antibodies against B. burgdorferi alone is not sufficient for a diagnosis of equine Lyme disease, and unspecific testing for antibodies is not recommended. [333]\n\nTypical treatment involves antibiotics such as oxytetracycline, doxycycline, ceftriaxone, or minocycline. [334][335][330]  In some cases, a combination of antibiotics may be administered. Doxycycline and minocycline are taken orally, while oxytetracycline and ceftriaxone are usually administered intravenously. [335][336][330]  The duration and dosage of treatment vary widely among cases. In most cases, the infected  horse  is  euthanized. [c]   Death  of  horses  as  a  result  of Borrelia  burgdorferi infection  remains unknown. [338]\n\nCurrently,  there  is  no  approved  Lyme  disease  vaccine  for  horses. [339]   However,  a  study  demonstrated  that ponies  could  be  protected  using  an  aluminum  adjuvanted  recombinant  outer-surface  protein  A  (rOspA) vaccine. [340]  While horses have been administered a Lyme disease vaccine designed for dogs, it elicits only a short-lasting antibody response. [339]  Another study supports the use of commercial Lyme disease vaccines, showing that they do elicit an antibody response, which can be significantly enhanced when horses receive an additional booster vaccine.
