[10]   Typical  features  of  the  condition  include blackheads  or  whiteheads,  pimples,  oily  skin,  and  possible scarring. [1][2][11]   It  primarily  affects  skin  with  a  relatively  high number of oil glands, including the face, upper part of the chest, and  back.

        "text": "# Classification\n\nThere are six main types of acne: blackheads, whiteheads, papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts. The severity of acne vulgaris (Gr. ἀ κμή, \"point\" + L. vulgaris , \"common\") [24]  can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe to determine an appropriate treatment regimen. [20]  There is no universally accepted scale for grading acne severity. [15]  The presence of clogged skin follicles (known as comedones) limited to the face with occasional inflammatory lesions defines mild acne. [20]  Moderate severity acne is said to occur when a higher number of inflammatory papules and pustules occur on the face, compared to mild cases of acne, and appear on the trunk of the body. [20]  Severe acne is said to occur when nodules (the painful 'bumps' lying under the skin) are the characteristic facial lesions, and involvement of the trunk is extensive. [20][25]\n\nThe lesions are usually polymorphic, meaning they can take many forms, including open or closed comedones (commonly known as blackheads and whiteheads), papules, pustules, and even nodules or cysts so that these lesions  often  leave  behind  sequelae,  or  abnormal  conditions  resulting  from  a  previous  disease,  such  as scarring or hyperpigmentation.

[25]  True cysts are rare in those with acne, and the term severe nodular acne is now the preferred terminology. [25]\n\nAcne inversa (L. invertō, \"upside-down\") and acne rosacea (rosa, \"rose-colored\" + -āceus, \"forming\") are not forms of acne and are alternate names that respectively refer to the skin conditions hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and rosacea. [27][28][29]   Although  HS  shares  certain  overlapping  features  with  acne  vulgaris,  such  as  a tendency to clog skin follicles with skin cell debris, the condition otherwise lacks the hallmark features of acne and is therefore considered a distinct skin disorder. [27]\n\n\n## Signs and symptoms\n\nTypical features of acne include increased secretion of oily sebum by the skin, microcomedones, comedones, papules, nodules (large papules), pustules, and often results in scarring.

[32]   Abnormal  healing  and  dermal  inflammation  create  the  scar. [33]   Scarring  is  most  likely  to  take place with severe acne but may occur with any form of acne vulgaris. [32]  Acne scars are classified based on whether the abnormal healing response following dermal inflammation leads to excess collagen deposition or loss at the site of the acne lesion. [34]\n\nAtrophic acne scars have lost collagen from the healing response and are the most common type of acne scar (accounting for approximately 75% of all acne scars). [33][34]  Ice-pick scars, boxcar scars, and rolling scars are subtypes of atrophic acne scars. [32]  Boxcar scars are round or ovoid indented scars with sharp borders and vary  in  size  from  1.5-4  mm  across. [33]   Ice-pick  scars  are  narrow  (less  than  2  mm  across),  deep  scars  that extend into the dermis.

        "text": "# Pigmentation\n\nAfter an inflamed nodular acne lesion resolves, it is common for the skin to darken in that area, which is known as postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH).  The  inflammation  stimulates  specialized  pigment-producing  skin cells (known as melanocytes) to produce more melanin pigment, which leads to the skin's darkened appearance. [36]  PIH occurs more frequently in people with darker skin color. [37]  Pigmented scar is a common term used for PIH, but is misleading as it suggests the color change is permanent. Often, PIH can  be  prevented  by  avoiding  any  aggravation  of  the  nodule  and  can  fade with  time.  However,  untreated  PIH  can  last  for  months,  years,  or  even  be permanent  if  deeper  layers  of  skin  are  affected. [38]   Even  minimal  skin exposure  to  the  sun's  ultraviolet  rays  can  sustain  hyperpigmentation. [36] Daily  use  of  SPF  15  or  higher  sunscreen  can  minimize  such  a  risk.

[29]  Many features may indicate that a person's acne vulgaris is sensitive to hormonal influences. Historical and physical clues that may suggest hormone-sensitive acne include onset between ages 20 and 30; worsening the week before a woman's period; acne lesions predominantly over the jawline and chin; and inflammatory/nodular acne lesions.

Leeds scores range from 0 (least severe) to 10 (most severe) though modified scales have a maximum score of 12.

[10]   Typical  features  of  the  condition  include blackheads  or  whiteheads,  pimples,  oily  skin,  and  possible scarring. [1][2][11]   It  primarily  affects  skin  with  a  relatively  high number of oil glands, including the face, upper part of the chest, and  back. [12]   The  resulting  appearance  can  lead  to  lack  of confidence, anxiety, reduced self-esteem, and, in extreme cases, depression or thoughts of suicide. [3][4]\n\nSusceptibility  to  acne  is  primarily  genetic  in  80%  of  cases. [2] The  roles  of  diet  and  cigarette  smoking  in  the  condition  are unclear,  and  neither  cleanliness  nor  exposure  to  sunlight  are associated  with  acne. [2][13][14]   In  both  sexes,  hormones  called androgens appear to be part of the underlying mechanism, by causing  increased  production  of  sebum. [5]   Another  common factor  is  the  excessive  growth  of  the  bacterium Cutibacterium acnes , which is present on the skin. [15]\n\nTreatments  for  acne  are  available,  including  lifestyle  changes, medications,  and  medical  procedures.  Eating  fewer  simple carbohydrates  such  as  sugar  may  minimize  the  condition. [7] Treatments applied directly to the affected skin, such as azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and salicylic acid, are commonly used. [8] Antibiotics and retinoids are available in formulations that are applied  to  the  skin  and  taken  by  mouth  for  the  treatment  of acne. [8]   However,  resistance  to  antibiotics  may  develop  as  a result  of  antibiotic  therapy. [16]   Several  types  of  birth  control pills  help  prevent  acne  in  women.

        "text": "# Classification\n\nThere are six main types of acne: blackheads, whiteheads, papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts. The severity of acne vulgaris (Gr. ἀ κμή, \"point\" + L. vulgaris , \"common\") [24]  can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe to determine an appropriate treatment regimen. [20]  There is no universally accepted scale for grading acne severity. [15]  The presence of clogged skin follicles (known as comedones) limited to the face with occasional inflammatory lesions defines mild acne. [20]  Moderate severity acne is said to occur when a higher number of inflammatory papules and pustules occur on the face, compared to mild cases of acne, and appear on the trunk of the body. [20]  Severe acne is said to occur when nodules (the painful 'bumps' lying under the skin) are the characteristic facial lesions, and involvement of the trunk is extensive. [20][25]\n\nThe lesions are usually polymorphic, meaning they can take many forms, including open or closed comedones (commonly known as blackheads and whiteheads), papules, pustules, and even nodules or cysts so that these lesions  often  leave  behind  sequelae,  or  abnormal  conditions  resulting  from  a  previous  disease,  such  as scarring or hyperpigmentation. [26]\n\nLarge nodules were previously called cysts. The term nodulocystic has been used in the medical literature to describe severe cases of inflammatory acne. [25]  True cysts are rare in those with acne, and the term severe nodular acne is now the preferred terminology. [25]\n\nAcne inversa (L. invertō, \"upside-down\") and acne rosacea (rosa, \"rose-colored\" + -āceus, \"forming\") are not forms of acne and are alternate names that respectively refer to the skin conditions hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and rosacea. [27][28][29]   Although  HS  shares  certain  overlapping  features  with  acne  vulgaris,  such  as  a tendency to clog skin follicles with skin cell debris, the condition otherwise lacks the hallmark features of acne and is therefore considered a distinct skin disorder. [27]\n\n\n## Signs and symptoms\n\nTypical features of acne include increased secretion of oily sebum by the skin, microcomedones, comedones, papules, nodules (large papules), pustules, and often results in scarring. [30][31]  The appearance of acne varies with skin color. It may result in psychological and social problems. [20]\n\n\n## Scars\n\nAcne scars are caused by inflammation within the dermis and are estimated to affect 95% of people with acne vulgaris. [32]   Abnormal  healing  and  dermal  inflammation  create  the  scar. [33]   Scarring  is  most  likely  to  take place with severe acne but may occur with any form of acne vulgaris. [32]  Acne scars are classified based on whether the abnormal healing response following dermal inflammation leads to excess collagen deposition or loss at the site of the acne lesion. [34]\n\nAtrophic acne scars have lost collagen from the healing response and are the most common type of acne scar (accounting for approximately 75% of all acne scars). [33][34]  Ice-pick scars, boxcar scars, and rolling scars are subtypes of atrophic acne scars. [32]  Boxcar scars are round or ovoid indented scars with sharp borders and vary  in  size  from  1.5-4  mm  across. [33]   Ice-pick  scars  are  narrow  (less  than  2  mm  across),  deep  scars  that extend into the dermis. [33]  Rolling scars are broader than ice-pick and boxcar scars (4-5 mm across) and have a wave-like pattern of depth in the skin. [33]\n\nHypertrophic scars are uncommon and are characterized by increased collagen content after the abnormal healing response. [33]  They are described as firm and raised from the skin. [33][35]  Hypertrophic scars remain within  the  original  margins  of  the  wound,  whereas  keloid  scars  can  form  scar  tissue  outside  of  these borders. [33]  Keloid scars from acne occur more often in men and people with darker skin, and usually occur on the trunk of the body. [33]"

        "text": "# Pigmentation\n\nAfter an inflamed nodular acne lesion resolves, it is common for the skin to darken in that area, which is known as postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH).  The  inflammation  stimulates  specialized  pigment-producing  skin cells (known as melanocytes) to produce more melanin pigment, which leads to the skin's darkened appearance. [36]  PIH occurs more frequently in people with darker skin color. [37]  Pigmented scar is a common term used for PIH, but is misleading as it suggests the color change is permanent. Often, PIH can  be  prevented  by  avoiding  any  aggravation  of  the  nodule  and  can  fade with  time.  However,  untreated  PIH  can  last  for  months,  years,  or  even  be permanent  if  deeper  layers  of  skin  are  affected. [38]   Even  minimal  skin exposure  to  the  sun's  ultraviolet  rays  can  sustain  hyperpigmentation. [36] Daily  use  of  SPF  15  or  higher  sunscreen  can  minimize  such  a  risk. [38] Whitening agents like azelaic acid, arbutin or else may be used to improve hyperpigmentation. [39]\n\n\n## Causes\n\nRisk factors for the development of acne, other than genetics, have not been conclusively  identified.  Possible  secondary  contributors  include  hormones, infections, diet,  and stress.  Studies  investigating the impact of smoking on the incidence and severity of acne have been inconclusive. [2][40][41] Cleanliness (hygiene) and sunlight are not associated with acne. [14]\n\n\n## Genes\n\nAcne appears to be highly heritable; genetics explain 81% of the variation in the  population. [15]   Studies  performed  in  affected  twins  and  first-degree relatives  further  demonstrate  the  strongly  inherited  nature  of  acne. [2][15] Acne  susceptibility  is  likely  due  to  the  influence  of  multiple  genes,  as  the disease does not follow a classic (Mendelian) inheritance pattern. These gene candidates include certain variations in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), IL-1 alpha, and CYP1A1 genes, among others. [19]  The 308 G/A single nucleotide polymorphism variation in the gene for TNF is associated with an increased risk for  acne. [42]   Acne  can  be  a  feature  of  rare  genetic  disorders such  as  Apert's  syndrome. [15]   Severe  acne  may  be  associated  with  XYY syndrome. [43]\n\n\n## Hormones\n\nHormonal activity, such as occurs during menstrual cycles and puberty, may contribute  to  the  formation  of  acne.  During  puberty,  an  increase  in  sex hormones called androgens causes the skin follicle glands to grow larger and make more oily sebum. [12] The androgen hormones testosterone, dihydrotestosterone  (DHT),  and  dehydroepiandrosterone  (DHEA)  are  all\n\nA severe case of nodular acne\n\nlinked  to  acne.  High  levels  of  growth  hormone  (GH)  and  insulin-like  growth  factor  1  (IGF-1)  are  also associated with worsened acne. [44]  Both androgens and IGF-1 seem to be essential for acne to occur, as acne does not develop in individuals with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) or Laron syndrome (insensitivity to GH, resulting in very low IGF-1 levels). [45][46]\n\nMedical  conditions  that  commonly  cause  a  high-androgen  state,  such  as  polycystic  ovary  syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and androgen-secreting tumors, can cause acne in affected individuals. [47][48] Conversely, people who lack androgenic hormones or are insensitive to the effects of androgens rarely have acne. [47]  Pregnancy can increase androgen levels, and consequently, oily sebum synthesis. [48][49]  Acne can be a side effect of testosterone replacement therapy or anabolic steroid use. [1][50]  Over-the-counter bodybuilding and dietary supplements often contain illegally added anabolic steroids. [1][51]"

        "text": "# Infections\n\nThe anaerobic bacterial species Cutibacterium acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes ) contributes to the development of acne, but its exact role is not well understood. [2]  There are specific sub-strains of C.  acnes associated with normal skin and others with moderate or severe inflammatory acne. [52]  It is unclear whether these  undesirable  strains  evolve  on-site  or  are  acquired,  or  possibly  both  depending  on  the  person.  These strains have the capability of changing, perpetuating, or adapting to the abnormal cycle of inflammation, oil production,  and  inadequate  sloughing  of  dead  skin  cells  from  acne  pores.  Some  studies  have  explored  a possible  link  between  Demodex  mites  and  acne,  though  findings  remain  inconclusive. [31][53]   It  is  unclear whether eradication of the mite improves acne. [53]\n\n\n## Diet\n\nHigh-glycemic-load  diets  have  been  found  to  have  different  degrees  of  effect  on  acne  severity. [7][54][55] Multiple randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized studies have found a lower-glycemic-load diet to be effective in reducing acne. [54]  There is weak observational evidence suggesting that dairy milk consumption is positively associated with a higher frequency and severity of acne. [53][54][56][57][58]  Milk contains whey protein and  hormones  such  as  bovine  IGF-1  and  precursors  of  dihydrotestosterone. [54]   Studies  suggest  these components  promote  the  effects  of  insulin  and  IGF-1  and  thereby  increase  the  production  of  androgen hormones, sebum, and promote the formation of comedones. [54]  Available evidence does not support a link between eating chocolate or salt and acne severity. [56][57]  Few studies have examined the relationship between obesity and acne. [2]  Vitamin B 12  may trigger skin outbreaks similar to acne (acneiform eruptions), or worsen existing acne when taken in doses exceeding the recommended daily intake. [59]\n\n\n## Stress\n\nThere  are  few  high-quality  studies  to  demonstrate  that  stress  causes  or  worsens  acne. [60]   Despite  being controversial,  some  research  indicates  that  increased  acne  severity  is  associated  with  high  stress  levels  in certain contexts, such as hormonal changes seen in premenstrual syndrome. [61][62]\n\n\n## Other\n\nSome individuals experience severe intensification of their acne when they are exposed to hot humid climates; this  is  due  to  bacteria  and  fungus  thriving  in  warm,  moist  environments.  This  climate-induced  acne exacerbation  has  been  termed  tropical  acne.  Mechanical  obstruction  of  skin  follicles  with  helmets  or chinstraps can worsen pre-existing acne. [63]  However, acne caused by mechanical obstruction is technically not acne vulgaris, but another acneiform eruption known as acne mechanica.\n\nSeveral  medications  can  also  worsen  pre-existing  acne;  this  condition  is  the  acne  medicamentosa  form  of acne. Examples of such medications include lithium, hydantoin, isoniazid, glucocorticoids, iodides, bromides, and testosterone. [43]  When acne medicamentosa is specifically caused by anabolic-androgenic steroids it can simply be referred to as steroid acne.\n\nGenetically  susceptible  individuals  can  get  acne  breakouts  as  a  result  of  polymorphous  light  eruption;  a condition triggered by sunlight and artificial UV light exposure. This form of acne is called Acne aestivalis and is  specifically  caused  by  intense  UVA  light  exposure.  Affected  individuals  usually  experience  seasonal  acne breakouts on their upper arms, shoulder girdle, back, and chest. The breakouts typically occur one-to-three days after exposure to intese UVA radiation. Unlike other forms of acne, the condition spares the face; this could possibly be a result of the pathogenesis of polymorphous light eruption, in which areas of the skin that are newly exposed to intense ultraviolet radiation are affected. Since faces are typically left uncovered at all stages  of  life,  there  is  little-to-no  likelihood  for  an  eruption  to  appear  there.  Studies  show  that  both polymorphous light eruption outbreaks and the acne aestivalis breakout response can be prevented by topical antioxidants combined with the application of a broad spectrum sunscreen.

        "text": "# Pathophysiology\n\nAcne vulgaris is a chronic skin disease of the pilosebaceous unit  and  develops  due  to  blockages  in  the  skin's  hair follicles. [52]\n\nTraditionally seen as a disease of adolescence, acne vulgaris is also observed in adults, including postmenopausal  women.  Acne  vulgaris  manifested  in  adult female  is  called adult  female  acne (AFA),  defined  as  a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit. [26] Particularly  in  AFA,  during  the  menopausal  transition,  a relative  increase  in  androgen  levels  occurs  as  estrogen levels  begin  to  decline,  so  that  this  hormonal  shift  can manifest as acne; while most women with AFA exhibit few acne  lesions  and  have  normal  androgen  levels,  baseline investigations,  including  an  androgen  testing  panel,  can help  rule  out  associated  comorbidities  such  as  polycystic ovarian syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, or tumors. [26]\n\nThe  blockages  in  the  skin's  hair  follicles  that  cause  acne vulgaris  manifestations  occur  as  a  result  of  the  following four abnormal processes: increased oily sebum production (influenced  by  androgens),  excessive  deposition  of  the protein keratin leading to comedo formation, colonization of the follicle by Cutibacterium acnes ( C. acnes )  bacteria, and the local release of pro-inflammatory chemicals in the skin. [52]\n\nThe earliest pathologic change is the formation of a plug (a microcomedone),  which  is  driven  primarily  by  excessive growth, reproduction, and accumulation of skin cells in the hair follicle. [1]  In healthy skin, the skin cells that have died come  up  to  the  surface  and  exit  the  pore  of  the  hair follicle. [10]   In  people  with  acne,  the  increased  production of oily sebum causes the dead skin cells to stick together. [10]  The accumulation of dead skin cell debris and oily sebum blocks the pore of the hair follicle, thus forming\n\nthe  microcomedone. [10]   The C.  acnes biofilm  within  the  hair  follicle  worsens  this  process. [47]   If  the microcomedone is superficial within the hair follicle, the skin pigment melanin is exposed to air, resulting in its  oxidation  and  dark  appearance  (known  as  a  blackhead  or  open  comedo). [1][10][20]   In  contrast,  if  the microcomedone occurs deep within the hair follicle, this causes the formation of a whitehead (known as a closed comedo). [1][10]\n\nThe main hormonal driver of oily sebum production in the skin is dihydrotestosterone. [1]  Another androgenic hormone responsible for increased  sebaceous  gland  activity  is  DHEA-S.  The  adrenal  glands  secrete  higher amounts  of  DHEA-S  during  adrenarche  (a  stage  of  puberty),  and  this  leads  to  an  increase  in  sebum production. In a sebum-rich skin environment, the naturally occurring and largely commensal skin bacterium C.  acnes readily  grows  and  can  cause  inflammation  within  and  around  the  follicle  due  to  activation  of  the innate immune system. [10] C. acnes triggers skin inflammation  in  acne  by  increasing  the  production  of several pro-inflammatory chemical signals (such as IL-1α, IL-8,  TNF-α,  and  LTB4);  IL-1α  is  essential  to  comedo formation.

        "text": "C.  acnes' ability  to  bind  and  activate  a  class  of  immune system  receptors  known  as  toll-like  receptors  (TLRs), especially  TLR2 and TLR4, is a core mechanism of acnerelated  skin  inflammation. [47][65][66]   Activation  of  TLR2 and TLR4 by C. acnes leads to increased secretion of IL-1α, IL-8,  and  TNF-α. [47]   The  release  of  these  inflammatory signals  attracts  various  immune  cells  to  the  hair  follicle, including neutrophils, macrophages, and Th1 cells. [47]  IL1α stimulates increased skin cell activity and reproduction, which, in turn, fuels comedo development. [47] Furthermore, sebaceous gland cells produce more antimicrobial  peptides,  such  as  HBD1  and  HBD2,  in response to the binding of TLR2 and TLR4. [47]\n\nC.  acnes also  provokes  skin  inflammation  by  altering  the fatty composition of oily sebum. [47]  Oxidation of the lipid squalene by C. acnes is of particular importance. Squalene oxidation activates NF-κB (a protein complex) and consequently increases IL-1α levels. [47] Additionally, squalene oxidation increases 5-lipoxygenase enzyme activity, which catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to leukotriene B4 (LTB4). [47] LTB4 promotes skin inflammation  by  acting  on  the  peroxisome  proliferatoractivated receptor alpha (PPARα) protein. [47]   PPARα increases the activity of activator protein 1 (AP-1) and NFκB, thereby leading to the recruitment of inflammatory T\n\nWhitehead\n\nBlackhead\n\nHair follicle anatomy demonstrating a healthy hair follicle (pictured left), a whitehead or closed comedo (middle picture), and a blackhead or open comedo (pictured right)\n\ncells. [47] C. acnes' ability to convert sebum triglycerides to pro-inflammatory free fatty acids via secretion of the  enzyme  lipase  further  explains  its  inflammatory  properties. [47]   These  free  fatty  acids  spur  increased production of cathelicidin, HBD1, and HBD2, thus leading to further inflammation. [47]\n\nThis inflammatory cascade typically leads to the formation of inflammatory acne lesions, including papules, infected pustules, or nodules. [1]  If the inflammatory reaction is severe, the follicle can break into the deeper layers  of  the  dermis  and  subcutaneous  tissue  and  cause  the  formation  of  deep  nodules. [1][67][68]   The involvement of AP-1 in the aforementioned inflammatory cascade activates matrix metalloproteinases, which contribute to local tissue destruction and scar formation. [47]\n\nAlong with the bacteria C. acnes , the bacterial species Staphylococcus epidermidis ( S. epidermidis ) also takes a part in the physiopathology of acne vulgaris. The proliferation of S. epidermidis with C. acnes causes the formation of biofilms, which blocks the hair follicles and pores, creating an anaerobic environment under the skin. This enables for increased growth of both C. acnes and S. epidermidis under the skin. The proliferation of C. acnes causes the formation of biofilms and a biofilm matrix, making it even harder to treat the acne. [69]\n\n\n## Diagnosis\n\nAcne vulgaris is diagnosed based on a medical professional's clinical judgment. [15]  The evaluation of a person with suspected acne should include taking a detailed medical history about a family history of acne, a review of medications taken, signs or symptoms of excessive production of androgen hormones, cortisol, and growth hormone. [15]  Comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) must be present to diagnose acne. In their absence, an appearance similar to that of acne would suggest a different skin disorder. [29]  Microcomedones (the precursor to  blackheads  and  whiteheads)  are  not  visible  to  the  naked  eye  when  inspecting  the  skin  and  require  a microscope to be seen. [29]  Many features may indicate that a person's acne vulgaris is sensitive to hormonal influences. Historical and physical clues that may suggest hormone-sensitive acne include onset between ages 20 and 30; worsening the week before a woman's period; acne lesions predominantly over the jawline and chin; and inflammatory/nodular acne lesions.

        "text": "Several scales exist to grade the severity of acne vulgaris, but disagreement persists about the ideal one for diagnostic use. [70][71]  Cook's acne grading scale uses photographs to grade severity from 0 to 8, with higher numbers representing more severe acne. This scale was the first to use a standardized photographic protocol to assess acne severity; since its creation in 1979, the scale has undergone several revisions. [71]  The Leeds acne grading technique counts acne lesions on the face, back, and chest and categorizes them as inflammatory or non-inflammatory. Leeds scores range from 0 (least severe) to 10 (most severe) though modified scales have a maximum score of 12. [71][72]  The Pillsbury acne grading scale classifies the severity of the acne from grade 1 (least severe) to grade 4 (most severe). [70][73]\n\n\n# Differential diagnosis\n\nMany skin conditions can mimic acne vulgaris, and these are collectively known as acneiform eruptions. [29] Such conditions include angiofibromas, epidermal cysts, flat warts, folliculitis, keratosis pilaris, milia, perioral dermatitis,  and  rosacea,  among  others. [20][74]   Age  is  one  factor  that  may  help  distinguish  between  these disorders. Skin disorders such as perioral dermatitis and keratosis pilaris can appear similar to acne but tend to  occur  more  frequently  in  childhood.  Rosacea  tends  to  occur  more  frequently  in  older  adults. [20]   Facial redness triggered by heat or the consumption of alcohol or spicy food is also more suggestive of rosacea. [75] The presence of comedones helps health professionals differentiate acne from skin disorders that are similar in  appearance. [8]   Chloracne  and  occupational  acne  due  to  exposure  to  certain  chemicals  &  industrial compounds, may look very similar to acne vulgaris. [76]\n\n\n## Management\n\nMany  different  treatments  exist  for  acne.  These  include  alpha  hydroxy  acid,  anti-androgen  medications, antibiotics,  antiseborrheic  medications,  azelaic  acid,  benzoyl  peroxide,  hormonal  treatments,  keratolytic soaps, nicotinamide (niacinamide), retinoids, and salicylic acid. [77][78]  Acne treatments work in at least four different ways, including the following: reducing inflammation, hormonal manipulation, killing C. acnes , and normalizing skin cell shedding and sebum production in the pore to prevent blockage. [15]  Typical treatments include  topical  therapies  such  as  antibiotics,  benzoyl  peroxide,  and  retinoids,  and  systemic  therapies, including antibiotics, hormonal agents, and oral retinoids. [20][79]\n\nRecommended  therapies  for  first-line  use  in  acne  vulgaris  treatment  include  topical  retinoids,  benzoyl peroxide, and topical or oral antibiotics. [80]  Procedures such as light therapy and laser therapy are not firstline treatments and typically have only an add on role due to their high cost and limited evidence. [79]  Blue light therapy is of unclear benefit. [81]  Medications for acne target the early stages of comedo formation and are generally ineffective for visible skin lesions; acne generally improves between eight and twelve weeks after starting therapy. [15]\n\nPeople  often  view  acne  as  a  short-term  condition,  some  expecting  it  to  disappear  after  puberty.  This misconception  can  lead  to  depending  on  self-management  or  problems  with  long-term  adherence  to treatment.  Communicating the long-term nature of the condition and better access to reliable information about acne can help people know what to expect from treatments. [82][83]"

        "text": "# Skin care\n\nIn general, it is recommended that people with acne do not wash affected skin more than twice daily. [15]  The application  of  a  fragrance-free  moisturizer  to  sensitive  and  acne-prone  skin  may  reduce  irritation.  Skin irritation from acne medications typically peaks at two weeks after onset of use and tends to improve with continued use. [15]  Dermatologists recommend using cosmetic products that specifically say non-comedogenic, oil-free, and will not clog pores. [15]\n\nAcne vulgaris patients, even those with oily skin, [84]  should moisturize in order to support the skin's moisture barrier since skin barrier dysfunction may contribute to acne. [84]  Moisturizers, especially ceramide-containing moisturizers,  as  an  adjunct  therapy  are  particularly  helpful  for  the  dry  skin  and  irritation  that  commonly results  from  topical  acne  treatment.  Studies  show  that  ceramide-containing  moisturizers  are  important  for optimal  skin  care;  they  enhance  acne  therapy  adherence  and  complement  existing  acne  therapies. [84]   In  a study where acne patients used 1.2% clindamycin phosphate / 2.5% benzoyl peroxide gel in the morning and applied a micronized 0.05% tretinoin gel in the evening the overwhelming majority of patients experienced no cutaneous adverse events throughout the study. It was concluded that using ceramide cleanser and ceramide moisturizing  cream  caused  the  favorable  tolerability,  did  not  interfere  with  the  treatment  efficacy,  and improved  adherence  to  the  regimen. [85]   The  importance  of  preserving  the  acidic  mantle  and  its  barrier functions is widely accepted in the scientific community. Thus, maintaining a pH in the range 4.5 - 5.5 is essential in order to keep the skin surface in its optimal, healthy conditions. [86][87][88][89][90]\n\n\n## Diet\n\nCausal relationship is rarely observed with diet/nutrition and dermatologic conditions. Rather, associations some of them compelling - have been found between diet and outcomes including disease severity and the number of conditions experienced by a patient. Evidence is emerging in support of medical nutrition therapy as  a  way  of  reducing  the  severity  and  incidence  of  dermatologic  diseases,  including  acne.  Researchers observed a link between high glycemic index diets and acne. [91]  Dermatologists also recommend a diet low in simple sugars as a method of improving acne. [54]  As of 2014, the available evidence is insufficient to use milk restriction for this purpose. [54]\n\n\n## Medications\n\n\n## Benzoyl peroxide\n\nBenzoyl  peroxide  (BPO)  is  a  first-line  treatment  for  mild and moderate acne due to its effectiveness and mild sideeffects (mainly skin irritation). In the skin follicle, benzoyl peroxide kills C. acnes by oxidizing its proteins through the formation of oxygen free radicals and benzoic acid. These free radicals likely interfere with the bacterium's metabolism and ability to make proteins. [92][93] Additionally, benzoyl peroxide is mildly effective at breaking down comedones and inhibiting inflammation. [80][93]   Combination  products  use  benzoyl peroxide  with  a  topical  antibiotic  or  retinoid,  such  as benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide/adapalene, respectively. [37] Topical benzoyl peroxide is effective at treating acne. [94]\n\nSide effects include increased skin photosensitivity, dryness,  redness,  and  occasional  peeling. [95]   Sunscreen  use  is  often  advised  during  treatment,  to  prevent sunburn. Lower concentrations of benzoyl peroxide are just as effective as higher concentrations in treating acne but are associated with fewer side effects. [93][96]  Unlike antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide does not appear to generate bacterial antibiotic resistance. [95]"

        "text": "# Retinoids\n\nRetinoids are medications that reduce inflammation, normalize the follicle cell life cycle, and reduce sebum production. [47][97]   They  are  structurally  related  to  vitamin  A. [97]   Studies  show  dermatologists  and  primary care doctors underprescribe them for acne. [15]  The retinoids appear to influence the cell life cycle in the follicle lining.  This  helps  prevent  the  accumulation  of  skin  cells  within  the  hair  follicle  that  can  create  a  blockage. They are a first-line acne treatment, [1]  especially for people with dark-colored skin. Retinoids are known to lead to faster improvement of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. [37]\n\nTopical retinoids include adapalene, retinol, retinaldehyde, isotretinoin, tazarotene, trifarotene,  and tretinoin. [49][98][99]  They often cause an initial flare-up of acne and facial flushing and can cause significant skin  irritation.  Generally  speaking,  retinoids  increase  the  skin's  sensitivity  to  sunlight  and  are  therefore recommended  for  use  at  night. [1]   Tretinoin  is  the  least  expensive  of  the  topical  retinoids  and  is  the  most irritating  to  the  skin,  whereas  adapalene  is  the  least  irritating  but  costs  significantly  more. [1][100]   Most formulations of tretinoin are incompatible for use with benzoyl peroxide. [15]  Tazarotene is the most effective and  expensive  topical  retinoid  but  is  usually  not  as  well  tolerated. [1][100]   In  2019  a  tazarotene  lotion formulation, marketed to be a less irritating option, was approved by the FDA. [101]  Retinol is a form of vitamin A that has similar but milder effects and is present in many over-the-counter moisturizers and other topical products.\n\nIsotretinoin  is  an  oral  retinoid  that  is  very  effective  for  severe  nodular  acne,  and  moderate  acne  that  is stubborn to other treatments. [1][20]  One to two months of use is typically adequate to see improvement. Acne often resolves completely or is much milder after a 4-6 month course of oral isotretinoin. [1]  After a single round of treatment, about 80% of people report an improvement, with more than 50% reporting complete remission. [20]  About 20% of people require a second course, but 80% of those report improvement, resulting in a cumulative 96% efficacy rate. [20]\n\nThere are concerns that isotretinoin is linked to adverse effects, like depression, suicidality, and anemia. There is no clear evidence to support some of these claims. [1][20]  Isotretinoin has been found in some studies to be superior to antibiotics or placebo  in reducing  acne  lesions. [17]   However,  a  2018  review  comparing inflammatory lesions after treatment with antibiotics or isotretinoin found no difference. [102]  The frequency of adverse events was about twice as high with isotretinoin use, although these were mostly dryness-related events. [17]  No increased risk of suicide or depression was conclusively found. [17]\n\nMedical authorities strictly regulate isotretinoin use in women of childbearing age due to its known harmful effects  in  pregnancy. [20]   For  such  a  woman  to  be  considered  a  candidate  for  isotretinoin,  she  must  have  a confirmed negative pregnancy test and use an effective form of birth control. [20]  In 2008, the United States started  the  iPLEDGE  program  to  prevent  isotretinoin  use  during  pregnancy. [103]   iPLEDGE  requires  the woman to have two negative pregnancy tests and to use two types of birth control for at  least  one  month before isotretinoin therapy begins and one month afterward. [103]  The effectiveness of the iPLEDGE program is controversial due to continued instances of contraception nonadherence. [103][104]\n\n\n## Antibiotics\n\nPeople may apply antibiotics to the skin or take them orally to treat acne. They work by killing C. acnes and reducing inflammation. [20][95][105]   Although  multiple  guidelines  call  for  healthcare  providers  to  reduce  the rates of prescribed oral antibiotics, many providers do not follow this guidance. [106]  Oral antibiotics remain the most commonly prescribed systemic therapy for acne. [106]  Widespread broad-spectrum antibiotic overuse for acne has led to higher rates of antibiotic-resistant C. acnes strains worldwide, especially to the commonly used  tetracycline  (e.g.,  doxycycline)  and  macrolide  antibiotics  (e.g.,  topical  erythromycin). [16][95][105][106] Therefore, dermatologists prefer antibiotics as part of combination therapy and not for use alone. [15]\n\nCommonly used antibiotics,  either  applied  to  the  skin  or  taken  orally,  include  clindamycin,  erythromycin, metronidazole,  sulfacetamide,  and  tetracyclines  (e.g.,  doxycycline  or  minocycline). [49]   Doxycycline  40 milligrams  daily  (low-dose)  appears  to  have  similar  efficacy  to  100  milligrams  daily  and  has  fewer gastrointestinal  side  effects. [15]   However,  low-dose  doxycycline  is  not  FDA-approved  for  the  treatment  of acne. [107]   Antibiotics  applied  to  the  skin  are  typically  used  for  mild  to  moderately  severe  acne. [20]   Oral antibiotics are generally more effective than topical antibiotics and produce faster resolution of inflammatory acne lesions than topical applications. [1]  The Global Alliance to Improve Outcomes in Acne recommends that topical and oral antibiotics are not used together. [105]"

        "text": "Oral  antibiotics  are  recommended  for  no  longer  than  three  months  as  antibiotic  courses  exceeding  this duration are associated with the development of antibiotic resistance and show no clear benefit over shorter durations. [105]   If  long-term  oral  antibiotics  beyond  three  months  are  used,  then  it  is  recommended  that benzoyl peroxide or a retinoid be used at the same time to limit the risk of C.  acnes developing  antibiotic resistance. [105]\n\nThe antibiotic dapsone is effective against inflammatory acne when applied to the skin. It is generally not a first-line  choice  due  to  its  higher  cost  and  a  lack  of  clear  superiority  over  other  antibiotics. [1][15]   Topical dapsone is sometimes a preferred therapy in women or for people with sensitive or darker-toned skin. [15]  It is not recommended for use with benzoyl peroxide due to the risk of causing yellow-orange skin discoloration with this combination. [10]  Minocycline is an effective acne treatment, but it is not a first-line antibiotic due to a  lack  of  evidence  that  it  is  better  than  other  treatments,  and  concerns  about  its  safety  compared  to  other tetracyclines. [108]\n\nSarecycline is  the  most  recent  oral  antibiotic  developed  specifically  for  the  treatment  of  acne,  and  is  FDAapproved  for  the  treatment  of  moderate  to  severe  inflammatory  acne  in  patients  nine  years  of  age  and older. [109][110][111]   It  is  a  narrow-spectrum  tetracycline  antibiotic  that  exhibits  the  necessary  antibacterial activity against pathogens related to acne vulgaris and a low propensity for inducing antibiotic resistance. [112][113]  In clinical trials, sarecycline demonstrated clinical efficacy in reducing inflammatory acne lesions as early as three weeks and reduced truncal (back and chest) acne. [111][114]\n\n\n## Hormonal agents\n\nIn  women,  the  use  of  combined  birth  control  pills  can  improve  acne. [115]   These  medications  contain  an estrogen and a progestin. [116]  They work by decreasing the production of androgen hormones by the ovaries and  by  decreasing  the  free  and  hence  biologically  active  fractions  of  androgens,  resulting  in  lowered  skin production  of  sebum  and  consequently  reduce  acne  severity. [10][117]   First-generation  progestins  such  as norethindrone and norgestrel have androgenic properties and may worsen acne. [15]  Although oral estrogens decrease IGF-1 levels in some situations, which could theoretically improve acne symptoms, [118][119]  combined birth  control  pills  do  not  appear  to  affect  IGF-1  levels  in  fertile  women. [116][120]   Cyproterone  acetatecontaining birth control pills seem to decrease total and free IGF-1 levels. [121]  Combinations containing thirdor fourth-generation progestins, including desogestrel, dienogest, drospirenone, or norgestimate, as well as birth  control  pills  containing  cyproterone  acetate  or  chlormadinone  acetate,  are  preferred  for  women  with acne due to their stronger antiandrogenic effects. [122][123][124]  Studies have shown a 40 to 70% reduction in acne  lesions  with  combined  birth  control  pills. [117]   A  2014  review  found  that  oral  antibiotics  appear  to  be somewhat more effective than birth control pills at reducing the number of inflammatory acne lesions at three months. [125]  However, the two therapies are approximately equal in efficacy at six months for decreasing the number of inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total acne lesions. [125]  The authors of the analysis suggested that birth control pills may be a preferred first-line acne treatment, over oral antibiotics, in certain women due to  similar  efficacy  at  six  months  and  a  lack  of  associated  antibiotic  resistance. [125]   In  contrast  to  combined birth  control  pills,  progestogen-only  birth  control  forms  that  contain  androgenic  progestins  have  been associated with worsened acne. [106]\n\nAntiandrogens  such  as  cyproterone  acetate  and  spironolactone  can  successfully  treat  acne,  especially  in women with signs of excessive androgen production, such as increased hairiness or skin production of sebum, or  scalp  hair  loss. [10][49]   Spironolactone  is  an  effective  treatment  for  acne  in  adult  women. [126][127]   Unlike combined birth control pills, it is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for this purpose. [1][37][126]  Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist and is a useful acne treatment due to its ability to  additionally  block  the  androgen  receptor  at  higher  doses. [37][106]   Alone  or  in  combination  with  a  birth control pill, spironolactone has shown a 33 to 85% reduction in acne lesions in women. [117]  The effectiveness of spironolactone for acne appears to be dose-dependent. [117]  High-dose cyproterone acetate alone reportedly decreases acne symptoms in women by 75 to 90% within three months. [128]  It is usually combined with an estrogen to avoid menstrual irregularities and estrogen deficiency. [129]  The medication appears to be effective in  the  treatment  of  acne  in  males,  with  one  study  finding  that  a  high  dosage  reduced  inflammatory  acne lesions  by  73%. [130][131]   However,  spironolactone  and  cyproterone  acetate's  side  effects  in  males,  such  as gynecomastia, sexual dysfunction, and decreased bone mineral density, generally make their use for male acne impractical.

[49]  Women who are sexually active and who can  or  may  become  pregnant  should  use  an  effective  method  of  contraception  to  prevent  pregnancy  while taking an antiandrogen. [133]  Antiandrogens are often combined with birth control pills for this reason, which can result in additive efficacy. [37][134]  The FDA added a black-box warning to spironolactone about possible tumor risks based on preclinical research with very high doses (>100-fold clinical doses) and cautioned that unnecessary  use  of  the  medication  should  be  avoided. [80][106][135]   However,  several  large  epidemiological studies subsequently found no greater risk of tumors in association with spironolactone in humans. [106][136][137][138]   Conversely,  strong  associations  of  cyproterone  acetate  with  certain  brain  tumors have  been  discovered  and  its  use  has  been  restricted. [139][140][141]   The  brain  tumor  risk  with  cyproterone acetate is due to its strong progestogenic actions and is not related to antiandrogenic activity nor shared by other antiandrogens. [139][142][141]\n\nFlutamide,  a  pure  antagonist  of  the  androgen  receptor,  is  effective  in  treating  acne  in  women. [128][143]   It appears to reduce acne symptoms by 80 to 90% even at low doses, with several studies showing complete acne clearance. [128][144][145]  In one study, flutamide decreased acne scores by 80% within three months, whereas spironolactone decreased symptoms by only 40% in the same period. [145][146][147]  In a large long-term study, 97% of  women  reported  satisfaction  with  the  control  of  their  acne  with  flutamide. [148]   Although  effective, flutamide  has  a  risk  of  serious  liver  toxicity,  and  cases  of  death  in  women  taking  even  low  doses  of  the medication  to  treat  androgen-dependent  skin  and  hair  conditions  have  occurred. [149]   As  such,  the  use  of flutamide for acne has become increasingly limited, [148][150][151]  and it has been argued that continued use of flutamide  for  such  purposes  is  unethical. [149]   Bicalutamide,  a  pure  androgen  receptor  antagonist  with  the same mechanism as flutamide and with comparable or superior antiandrogenic efficacy but with a far lower risk of liver toxicity, is an alternative option to flutamide in the treatment of androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions in women. [133][152][153][154]\n\nClascoterone is a topical antiandrogen that has demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of acne in both males and females and was approved for clinical use for this indication in August 2020. [155][156][157][158][159]  It has  shown  no  systemic  absorption  or  associated  antiandrogenic  side  effects. [158][159][160]   In  a  small  direct head-to-head  comparison,  clascoterone  showed  greater  effectiveness  than  topical  isotretinoin. [158][159][160] 5α-Reductase inhibitors such as finasteride and dutasteride may be useful for the treatment of acne in both males  and  females  but  have  not  been  adequately  evaluated  for  this  purpose. [1][161][162][163]   Moreover,  5αreductase inhibitors have a strong potential for producing birth defects in male babies and this limits their use in women. [1][162]  However, 5α-reductase inhibitors are frequently used to treat excessive facial/body hair in women and can be combined with birth control pills to prevent pregnancy. [161]  There is no evidence as of 2010 to support the use of cimetidine or ketoconazole in the treatment of acne. [164]\n\nHormonal treatments for acne such as combined birth control pills  and  antiandrogens  may  be  considered first-line therapy for acne under many circumstances, including desired contraception, known or suspected hyperandrogenism,  acne  during  adulthood,  acne  that  flares  premenstrually,  and  when  symptoms  of significant sebum production (seborrhea) are co-present. [164]  Hormone therapy is effective for acne both in women with hyperandrogenism and in women with normal androgen levels. [164]"

        "text": "# Azelaic acid\n\nAzelaic acid is effective for mild to moderate acne when applied topically at a 15-20% concentration. [67][165][166][167]  Treatment twice daily for six months is necessary, and is as effective as topical benzoyl peroxide 5%, isotretinoin 0.05%, and erythromycin 2%. [168]  Azelaic acid is an effective acne treatment due to its ability to reduce skin cell accumulation in the follicle and its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. [67]  It has a slight skin-lightening effect due to its ability to inhibit melanin synthesis. Therefore, it is useful in treating individuals with acne who are also affected by post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. [1] Azelaic acid may cause skin irritation. [169]  It is less effective and more expensive than retinoids. [1]  Azelaic acid also  led  to  worse  treatment  response  when  compared  to  benzoyl  peroxide.  When  compared  to  tretinoin, azelaic acid makes little or no treatment response. [170]\n\n\n## Salicylic acid\n\nSalicylic acid is a topically applied beta-hydroxy acid that stops bacteria from reproducing and has keratolytic properties. [171][172]  It is less effective than retinoid therapy. [20]  Salicylic acid opens obstructed skin pores and promotes the shedding of epithelial skin cells. [171]  Dry skin is the most commonly seen side effect with topical application, though darkening of the skin can occur in individuals with darker skin types. [1]\n\n\n## Other medications\n\nTopical  and  oral  preparations  of  nicotinamide  (the  amide  form  of  vitamin  B 3 )  are  alternative  medical treatments. [173] Nicotinamide reportedly improves acne due to its anti-inflammatory properties [173] (influencing neutrophil chemotaxis, inhibiting the release of histamine,  suppressing  the  lymphocyte transformation  test,  and  reducing  nitric  oxide  synthase  production  induced  by  cytokines), [78]   its  ability  to suppress sebum production, and its wound healing properties. [173]  Topical and oral preparations of zinc are suggested treatments for acne; evidence to support their use for this purpose is limited. [174]  Zinc's capacities to reduce inflammation and sebum production as well as inhibit C. acnes growth are its proposed mechanisms for improving acne. [174]  Antihistamines may improve symptoms among those already taking isotretinoin due to their anti-inflammatory properties and their ability to suppress sebum production. [175]\n\nHydroquinone lightens the skin when applied topically by inhibiting tyrosinase, the enzyme responsible for converting the amino acid tyrosine to the skin pigment melanin, and is used to treat acne-associated postinflammatory  hyperpigmentation. [36]   By  interfering  with  the  production  of  melanin  in  the  epidermis, hydroquinone  leads  to  less  hyperpigmentation  as  darkened  skin  cells  are  naturally  shed  over  time. [36] Improvement  in  skin  hyperpigmentation  is  typically  seen  within  six  months  when  used  twice  daily. Hydroquinone is ineffective for hyperpigmentation affecting deeper layers of skin such as the dermis. [36]  The use of a sunscreen with SPF 15 or higher in the morning with reapplication every two hours is recommended when using hydroquinone. [36]  Its application only to affected areas lowers the risk of lightening the color of normal  skin  but  can  lead  to  a  temporary  ring  of  lightened  skin  around  the  hyperpigmented  area. [36] Hydroquinone is generally well-tolerated; side effects are typically mild (e.g., skin irritation) and occur with the use of a higher than the recommended 4% concentration. [36]  Most preparations contain the preservative sodium metabisulfite,  which  has  been  linked  to  rare  cases  of  allergic  reactions,  including  anaphylaxis  and severe  asthma  exacerbations  in  susceptible  people. [36]   In  extremely  rare  cases,  the  frequent  and  improper application of high-dose hydroquinone has been associated with a systemic condition known as exogenous ochronosis (skin discoloration and connective tissue damage from the accumulation of homogentisic acid). [36]\n\n\n## Combination therapy\n\nCombination therapy-using medications of  different  classes  together,  each  with  a  different  mechanism  of action-has been demonstrated to be a more effective approach to acne treatment than monotherapy. [10][49] The  use  of  topical  benzoyl  peroxide  and  antibiotics  together  is  more  effective  than  antibiotics  alone. [10] Similarly,  using  a  topical  retinoid  with  an  antibiotic  clears  acne  lesions  faster  than  the  use  of  antibiotics alone. [10]  Frequently used combinations include the following: antibiotic and benzoyl peroxide, antibiotic and topical  retinoid,  or  topical  retinoid  and  benzoyl  peroxide. [49]   Dermatologists  generally  prefer  combining benzoyl peroxide with a retinoid over the combination of a topical antibiotic with a retinoid. Both regimens are effective, but benzoyl peroxide does not lead to antibiotic resistance. [10]"

        "text": "# Pregnancy\n\nAlthough sebaceous gland activity in the skin increases during the late stages of pregnancy, pregnancy has not been  reliably  associated  with  worsened  acne  severity. [176]   In  general,  topically  applied  medications  are considered the first-line approach to acne treatment during pregnancy, as they have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus. [176]  Highly recommended therapies include topically applied  benzoyl  peroxide  (pregnancy  category  C)  and  azelaic  acid  (category  B). [176]   Salicylic  acid  carries  a category C safety rating due to higher systemic absorption (9-25%), and an association between the use of anti-inflammatory medications in the third trimester and adverse effects to the developing fetus including too little  amniotic  fluid  in  the  uterus  and  early  closure  of  the  babies'  ductus  arteriosus  blood  vessel. [49][176] Prolonged use of salicylic acid over significant areas of the skin or under occlusive (sealed) dressings is not recommended as these methods increase systemic absorption and the potential for fetal harm. [176]  Tretinoin (category  C)  and  adapalene  (category  C)  are  very  poorly  absorbed,  but  certain  studies  have  suggested teratogenic  effects  in  the  first  trimester. [176]   The  data  examining  the  association  between  maternal  topical retinoid  exposure  in  the  first  trimester  of  pregnancy  and  adverse  pregnancy  outcomes  is  limited. [177]   A systematic review of observational studies concluded that such exposure does not appear to increase the risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, stillbirths, premature births, or low birth weight. [177]  Similarly, in studies examining the effects of topical retinoids during pregnancy, fetal harm has not been seen in the second and third  trimesters. [176]   Nevertheless,  since  rare  harms  from  topical  retinoids  are  not  ruled  out,  they  are  not recommended for use during pregnancy due to persistent safety concerns. [177][178]  Retinoids contraindicated for use during pregnancy include the topical retinoid tazarotene, and oral retinoids isotretinoin and acitretin (all  category  X). [176]   Spironolactone  is  relatively  contraindicated  for  use  during  pregnancy  due  to  its antiandrogen effects. [1]  Finasteride is not recommended as it is highly teratogenic. [1]\n\nTopical antibiotics deemed safe during pregnancy include clindamycin, erythromycin, and metronidazole (all category B), due to negligible systemic absorption. [49][176]  Nadifloxacin and dapsone (category C) are other topical antibiotics that may be used to treat acne in pregnant women but have received less study. [49][176]  No adverse fetal events have been reported from the topical use of dapsone. [176]  If retinoids are used there is a high risk of abnormalities occurring in the developing fetus; women of childbearing age are therefore required to use effective birth control if retinoids are used to treat acne. [20]  Oral antibiotics deemed safe for pregnancy (all  category  B)  include  azithromycin,  cephalosporins,  and  penicillins. [176]   Tetracyclines  (category  D)  are contraindicated during pregnancy as they are known to deposit in developing fetal teeth, resulting in yellow discoloration  and  thinned  tooth  enamel. [1][176]   Their  use  during  pregnancy  has  been  associated  with  the development of acute fatty liver of pregnancy and is further avoided for this reason. [176]\n\n\n## Procedures\n\nLimited evidence supports comedo extraction, but it is an option for comedones that do not improve with standard treatment. [8][80]  Another procedure for immediate relief is the injection of a corticosteroid into an inflamed  acne  comedo. [80]   Electrocautery  and  electrofulguration  are  effective  alternative  treatments  for comedones. [179]\n\nLight therapy is a treatment method that involves delivering certain specific wavelengths of light to an area of skin  affected  by  acne.  Both  regular  and  laser  light  have  been  used.  The  evidence  for  light  therapy  as  a treatment for acne is weak and inconclusive. [8][180]   Various  light  therapies  appear  to  provide  a  short-term benefit, but data for long-term outcomes, and outcomes in those with severe acne, are sparse; [181]  it may have a  role  for  individuals  whose  acne  has  been  resistant  to  topical  medications. [10]   A  2016  meta-analysis  was unable  to  conclude  whether  light  therapies  were  more  beneficial  than  placebo  or  no  treatment,  nor  the duration of benefit. [182]"

        "text": "When regular light is used immediately following the application of a sensitizing substance to the skin such as aminolevulinic  acid  or  methyl  aminolevulinate,  the  treatment  is  referred  to  as  photodynamic  therapy (PDT). [106][165]  PDT has the most supporting evidence of all light therapy modalities. [80]  PDT treats acne by using various forms of light (e.g., blue light or red light) that preferentially target the pilosebaceous unit. [106] Once the light activates the sensitizing substance, this generates free radicals and reactive oxygen species in the skin, which purposefully damage the sebaceous glands and kill C. acnes bacteria. [106]  Many different types of nonablative lasers (i.e., lasers that do not vaporize the top layer of the skin but rather induce a physiologic response  in  the  skin  from  the  light)  have  been  used  to  treat  acne,  including  those  that  use  infrared wavelengths of light. Ablative lasers (such as CO 2  and fractional types) have also been used to treat active acne and its scars. When ablative lasers are used, the treatment is often referred to as laser resurfacing because, as mentioned previously, the entire upper layers of the skin are vaporized. [183]  Ablative lasers are associated with higher  rates  of  adverse  effects  compared  with  non-ablative  lasers,  with  examples  being  post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, persistent facial redness, and persistent pain. [8][184][185] Physiologically, certain wavelengths of light, used with or without accompanying topical chemicals, are thought to kill bacteria and decrease  the  size  and  activity  of  the  glands  that  produce  sebum. [165]   Disadvantages  of  light  therapy  can include  its  cost,  the  need  for  multiple  visits,  the  time  required  to  complete  the  procedure(s),  and  pain associated  with  some  of  the  treatment  modalities. [10]   Typical  side  effects  include  skin  peeling,  temporary reddening of the skin, swelling, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. [10]\n\n\n# Postacne scar treatment\n\nDermabrasion is an effective therapeutic procedure for reducing the appearance of superficial atrophic scars of the boxcar and rolling varieties. [33]  Ice-pick scars do not respond well to treatment with dermabrasion due to  their  depth. [33]   The  procedure  is  painful  and  has  many  potential  side  effects  such  as  skin  sensitivity  to sunlight, redness, and decreased pigmentation of the skin. [33]  Dermabrasion has fallen out of favor with the introduction of laser resurfacing. [33]  Unlike dermabrasion, there is no evidence that microdermabrasion is an effective treatment for acne. [8]\n\nDermal or subcutaneous fillers are substances injected into the skin to improve the appearance of acne scars. Fillers are used to increase natural collagen production in the skin and to increase skin volume and decrease the depth of acne scars. [186]   Examples of fillers  used  for  this  purpose  include  hyaluronic  acid;  poly(methyl methacrylate) microspheres with collagen; human and bovine collagen derivatives, and fat harvested from the person's own body (autologous fat transfer). [186]\n\nMicroneedling is a procedure in which an instrument with multiple rows of tiny needles is rolled over the skin to  elicit  a  wound  healing  response  and  stimulate  collagen  production to reduce the appearance of atrophic acne  scars  in  people  with  darker  skin  color. [183]   Notable  adverse  effects  of  microneedling  include  postinflammatory  hyperpigmentation  and  tram  track  scarring  (described  as  discrete  slightly  raised  scars  in  a linear  distribution  similar  to  a  tram  track).  The  latter  is  thought  to  be  primarily  attributable  to  improper technique by the practitioner, including the use of excessive pressure or inappropriately large needles. [183][187]\n\nA  clinical  study  assessing  the  efficacy  of  microneedling  vis-à-vis  with  application  of  topical  tazarotene  gel, 0.1% in the treatment of postacne facial scars, found that tazarotene gel when applied for a period of three to six months once every night, resulted in significant improvement of atrophic scars similar to microneedling. [188]\n\nSubcision is useful for the treatment of superficial atrophic acne scars and involves the use of a small needle to loosen the fibrotic adhesions that result in the depressed appearance of the scar. [189][190][191]\n\nChemical peels can be used to reduce the appearance of acne scars. [33]  Mild peels include those using glycolic acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, Jessner's solution, or a lower concentration (20%) of trichloroacetic acid. These peels only affect the epidermal layer of the skin and can be useful in the treatment of superficial acne scars as well as skin pigmentation changes from inflammatory acne. [33]  Higher concentrations of trichloroacetic acid (30-40%) are considered to be medium-strength peels and affect the skin as deep as the papillary dermis. [33] Formulations  of  trichloroacetic  acid  concentrated  to  50%  or  more  are  considered  to  be  deep  chemical peels. [33]  Medium-strength and deep-strength chemical peels are more effective for deeper atrophic scars but are more likely to cause side effects such as skin pigmentation changes, infection, and small white superficial cysts known as milia.

        "text": "# Alternative medicine\n\nResearchers are investigating complementary therapies as treatment for people with acne. [192]  Low-quality evidence suggests topical application of tea tree oil or bee venom may reduce the total number of skin lesions in those with acne. [192]  Tea tree oil appears to be approximately as effective as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid  but  is  associated  with  allergic  contact  dermatitis. [1]   Proposed  mechanisms  for  tea  tree  oil's  anti-acne effects  include  antibacterial  action  against C.  acnes and  anti-inflammatory  properties. [66]   Numerous  other plant-derived therapies have demonstrated positive effects against acne (e.g., basil oil; oligosaccharides from seaweed; however, few well-done studies have examined their use for this purpose. [193]  There is a lack of highquality evidence for the use of acupuncture, herbal medicine, or cupping therapy for acne. [192]\n\n\n## Self-care\n\nMany over-the-counter treatments in many forms are available, which are often known as cosmeceuticals. [194] Certain types of makeup may be useful to mask acne. [195]  In those with oily skin, a water-based product is often preferred. [195][196]\n\n\n## Prognosis\n\nAcne usually improves around the age of 20 but may persist into adulthood. [77]  Permanent physical scarring may occur. [20]  Rare complications from acne or its treatment include the formation of pyogenic granulomas, osteoma cutis, and acne with facial edema. [197]  Early and aggressive treatment of acne is advocated by some in the medical community to reduce the chances of these poor outcomes. [4]\n\n\n## Mental health impact\n\nThere  is  good  evidence  to  support  the  idea  that  acne  and  associated  scarring  negatively  affect  a  person's psychological  state,  worsen  mood,  lower  self-esteem,  and  are  associated  with  a  higher  risk  of  anxiety disorders, depression, and suicidal thoughts. [3][32][53][82]\n\nMisperceptions about acne's causative and aggravating factors are common, and people with acne often blame themselves, and others often blame those with acne for their condition. [198][82]  Such blame can worsen the affected  person's  sense  of  self-esteem. [198]   Until  the  20th  century,  even  among  dermatologists,  the  list  of causes  was  believed  to  include  excessive  sexual  thoughts  and  masturbation. [199]   Dermatology's  association with sexually transmitted infections, especially syphilis, contributed to the stigma. [199]\n\nAnother psychological complication of acne vulgaris is acne excoriée, which occurs when a person persistently picks  and  scratches  pimples,  irrespective  of  the  severity  of  their  acne. [61][200]   This  can  lead  to  significant scarring, changes in the affected person's skin pigmentation, and a cyclic worsening of the affected person's anxiety about their appearance. [61]\n\n\n## Epidemiology\n\nGlobally, acne affects approximately 650 million people, or about 9.4% of the population, as of 2010. [201]  It affects nearly 90% of people in Western societies during their teenage years, but can occur before adolescence and may persist into adulthood. [19][20][23]   While  acne  that  first  develops  between  the  ages  of  21  and  25  is uncommon, it affects 54% of women and 40% of men older than 25 years of age [49][202]  and has a lifetime prevalence  of  85%. [49]   About  20%  of  those  affected  have  moderate  or  severe  cases. [2]   It  is  slightly  more common in females than males (9.8% versus 9.0%). [201]  In those over 40 years old, 1% of males and 5% of females still have problems. [20]"

        "text": "Rates appear to be lower in rural societies. [22]  While some research has found it affects people of all ethnic groups, [203]  acne may not occur in the non-Westernized peoples of Papua New Guinea and Paraguay. [204]\n\nAcne  affects  40-50  million  people  in  the  United  States  (16%)  and  approximately  3-5  million  in  Australia (23%). [125][205]  Severe acne tends to be more common in people of Caucasian or Amerindian descent than in people of African descent. [21]\n\n\n# History\n\nHistorical records indicate that pharaohs had acne, which may be the earliest known reference to the disease. Sulfur's usefulness as a topical remedy for acne dates  back  to  at  least  the  reign  of  Cleopatra  (69-30  BCE). [206]   The  sixthcentury Greek physician Aëtius of Amida reportedly coined the term \" ionthos \" (ίονθωξ,) or \" acnae \", which seems to be a reference to facial skin lesions that occur during \"the 'acme' of life\" (puberty). [207]\n\nIn  the  16th  century,  the  French  physician  and  botanist  François  Boissier  de Sauvages de Lacroix provided one of the earlier descriptions of acne. He used the  term  \"psydracia  achne\"  to  describe  small,  red,  and  hard  tubercles  that altered a person's facial appearance during adolescence and were neither itchy nor painful. [207]\n\nThe recognition  and  characterization  of  acne  progressed  in  1776  when  Josef Plenck  (an  Austrian  physician)  published  a  book  that  proposed  the  novel concept of classifying skin diseases by their elementary (initial) lesions. [207]  In 1808  the  English  dermatologist  Robert  Willan  refined  Plenck's  work  by providing  the  first detailed  descriptions  of  several  skin  disorders  using morphologic  terminology  that  remains  in  use  today. [207]   Thomas  Bateman\n\ncontinued  and  expanded  on  Robert  Willan's  work  as  his  student  and  provided  the  first  descriptions  and illustrations of acne accepted as accurate by modern dermatologists. [207]  Erasmus Wilson, in 1842, was the first  to  make  the  distinction  between  acne  vulgaris  and  rosacea. [208]   The  first  professional  medical monograph dedicated entirely to acne was written by Lucius Duncan Bulkley and published in New York in 1885. [199][209]\n\nScientists initially hypothesized that acne represented a disease of the skin's hair follicle, and occurred due to blockage of the pore by sebum. During the 1880s, they observed bacteria by microscopy in skin samples from people with acne. Investigators believed the bacteria caused comedones, sebum production, and ultimately acne. [207]   During  the  mid-twentieth  century,  dermatologists  realized  that  no  single  hypothesized  factor (sebum, bacteria, or excess keratin) fully accounted for the disease in its entirety. [207]  This led to the current understanding that acne could be explained by a sequence of related events, beginning with blockage of the skin follicle  by  excessive  dead  skin  cells,  followed  by  bacterial  invasion  of  the  hair  follicle  pore,  changes  in sebum production, and inflammation. [207]\n\nThe  approach  to  acne  treatment  underwent  significant  changes  during  the  twentieth  century.  Retinoids became a medical treatment for acne in 1943. [97]  Benzoyl peroxide was first proposed as a treatment in 1958 and  remains  a  staple  of  acne  treatment. [210]   The  introduction  of  oral  tetracycline  antibiotics  (such  as minocycline) modified acne treatment in the 1950s. These reinforced the idea amongst dermatologists that bacterial growth on the skin plays an important role in causing acne. [207]  Subsequently, in the 1970s, tretinoin (original trade name Retin A) was found to be an effective treatment. [211]  The development of oral isotretinoin (sold  as  Accutane  and  Roaccutane)  followed. [212]   After  its  introduction  in  the  United  States  in  1982, [213]"

        "text": "scientists identified isotretinoin as a medication highly likely to cause birth defects if taken during pregnancy. In the United States, more than 2,000 women became pregnant while taking isotretinoin between 1982 and 2003, with most pregnancies ending in abortion or miscarriage. Approximately 160 babies were born with birth defects due to maternal use of isotretinoin during pregnancy. [214][215]\n\nTreatment of acne with topical  crushed  dry  ice,  known  as  cryoslush,  was  first  described  in  1907  but  is  no longer performed commonly. [216]  Before 1960, the use of X-rays was also a common treatment. [217][218]\n\n\n# Society and culture\n\nThe costs and social impact of acne are substantial. In the United States, acne vulgaris is responsible for more than 5 million doctor visits and costs over US$2.5 billion each year in direct costs. [13]  Similarly, acne vulgaris is responsible for 3.5 million doctor visits each year in the United Kingdom. [20]  Sales for the top ten leading acne treatment brands in the US in 2015 amounted to $352 million. [219]\n\nAcne vulgaris and its resultant scars are associated with significant social and academic difficulties that can last  into  adulthood. [32][220]   During  the  Great  Depression,  dermatologists  discovered  that  young  men  with acne had difficulty obtaining jobs. [199]  Until the 1930s, many people viewed acne as a trivial problem among middle-class girls because, unlike smallpox and tuberculosis, no one died from it, and a feminine problem, because boys were much less likely to seek medical assistance for it. [199]  During World War II, some soldiers in  tropical  climates  developed  such  severe  and  widespread  tropical  acne  on  their  bodies  that  they  were declared medically unfit for duty. [199]\n\n\n## Research\n\nEfforts  to  better  understand  the  mechanisms  of  sebum  production  are  underway.  This  research  aims  to develop  medications  that  target  and  interfere  with  the  hormones  that  are  known  to  increase  sebum production (e.g., IGF-1 and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone). [10]  Other sebum-lowering medications such as topical antiandrogens, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor modulators, and inhibitors of the stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 enzyme are also a focus of research efforts. [10][106]  Particles that release nitric oxide into the skin to decrease skin inflammation caused by C. acnes and the immune system have shown promise for improving acne in early clinical trials. [106]  Another avenue of early-stage research has focused on how to best use laser and light therapy to selectively destroy sebum-producing glands in the skin's hair follicles to reduce sebum production and improve acne appearance. [10]\n\nThe  use  of  antimicrobial  peptides  against C.  acnes is  under  investigation  as  a  treatment  for  acne  to overcoming antibiotic resistance. [10]  In 2007, scientists reported the first genome sequencing of a C. acnes bacteriophage (PA6). The authors proposed applying this research toward the development of bacteriophage therapy  as  an  acne  treatment  to  overcome  the  problems  associated  with  long-term  antibiotic  use,  such  as bacterial  resistance. [221]   Oral  and  topical  probiotics  are  under  evaluation  as  treatments  for  acne. [222] Probiotics  may  have  therapeutic  effects  for  those  affected  by  acne  due  to  their  ability  to  decrease  skin inflammation  and  improve  skin  moisture  by  increasing  the  skin's  ceramide  content. [222]   As  of  2014, knowledge of the effects of probiotics on acne in humans was limited. [222]\n\nDecreased  levels  of  retinoic  acid  in  the  skin  may  contribute  to  comedo  formation.  Researchers  are investigating methods to increase the skin's production of retinoic acid to address this deficiency. [10]  A vaccine against  inflammatory  acne  has  shown  promising  results  in  mice  and  humans. [52][223]   Some  have  voiced concerns about creating a vaccine designed to neutralize a stable community of normal skin bacteria that is known to protect the skin from colonization by more harmful microorganisms.
