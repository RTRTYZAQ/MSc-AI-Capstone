[2][3]  It results in redness, pimples, swelling, and small and superficial  dilated  blood  vessels. [2]   Often,  the  nose,  cheeks, forehead,  and  chin  are  most  involved. [3]   A  red,  enlarged  nose may occur in severe disease, a condition known as rhinophyma. [3]\n\nThe cause of rosacea is unknown. [2]  Risk factors are believed to include  a  family  history  of  the  condition. [3]   Factors  that  may potentially worsen the condition include heat, exercise, sunlight, cold,  spicy  food,  alcohol,  menopause,  psychological  stress,  or steroid cream on the face.

        "text": "# Rosacea\n\nRosacea is a long-term skin condition that typically affects the face. [2][3]  It results in redness, pimples, swelling, and small and superficial  dilated  blood  vessels. [2]   Often,  the  nose,  cheeks, forehead,  and  chin  are  most  involved. [3]   A  red,  enlarged  nose may occur in severe disease, a condition known as rhinophyma. [3]\n\nThe cause of rosacea is unknown. [2]  Risk factors are believed to include  a  family  history  of  the  condition. [3]   Factors  that  may potentially worsen the condition include heat, exercise, sunlight, cold,  spicy  food,  alcohol,  menopause,  psychological  stress,  or steroid cream on the face. [4]  Diagnosis is based on symptoms. [2]\n\nWhile  not  curable,  treatment  usually  improves  symptoms. [3] Treatment is typically with metronidazole, doxycycline, minocycline,  or  tetracycline. [5]   When  the  eyes  are  affected, azithromycin  eye  drops  may  help. [6]   Other  treatments  with tentative benefit include brimonidine cream, ivermectin cream, and isotretinoin. [5]  Dermabrasion or laser surgery may also be used. [3]  The use of sunscreen is typically recommended. [3]\n\nRosacea affects between 1% and 10% of people. [2]  Those affected are  most  often  30  to  50  years  old  and  female. [2]   Fair-skinned people  seem  to  be  more  commonly  affected. [7]   The  condition was  described  in The  Canterbury  Tales in  the  1300s,  and possibly as early as the 200s BC by Theocritus. [8][9]\n\n\n## Signs and symptoms\n\nRosacea typically begins with reddening (flushing) of the skin in symmetrical  patches  near  the  center  of  the  face. [11]   Common signs  can  depend  on  age  and  sex:  flushing  and  red  swollen patches  are  common  in  the  young,  small  and  visible  dilated blood  vessels  in  older  individuals,  and  swelling  of  the  nose  is common  in  men. [11]   Other  signs  include  lumps  on  the  skin (papules or pustules) and swelling of the face. [11]  Many people experience stinging or burning pain, and rarely itching.

The exact risk factors vary from person to person, and  some  people  with  rosacea  may  not  be  able  to  identify  any  consistent  factors.  Common  triggers  are ultraviolet light, temperature of weather and/or food, spicy foods, exercise, and emotional stress. [11][4]\n\n\n## Erythematotelangiectatic rosacea\n\nErythematotelangiectatic  rosacea [12]   (also  known  as  \"vascular  rosacea\" [12] )  is  characterized  by  prominent history  of  prolonged  (over  10  minutes)  flushing  reaction  to  various  stimuli,  such  as  emotional  stress,  hot drinks, alcohol, spicy foods, exercise, cold or hot weather, or hot baths and showers.

        "text": "# Glandular rosacea\n\nIn  glandular rosacea, men with thick sebaceous skin predominate, a disease  in  which  the  papules  are  edematous,  and  the  pustules  are often 0.5 to 1.0 cm in size, with nodulocystic lesions often present. [13]\n\n\n## Cause\n\nThe exact cause of rosacea is unknown. [2]  Triggers that cause episodes of flushing and blushing play a part in its development. Exposure to temperature extremes, strenuous exercise, heat from sunlight, severe sunburn,  stress,  anxiety,  cold  wind,  and  moving  to  a  warm  or  hot environment from a cold one, such as heated shops and offices during the winter, can each cause the face to become flushed. [2]  Certain foods and  drinks  can  also  trigger  flushing,  such  as  alcohol,  foods,  and beverages  containing  caffeine  (especially  hot  tea  and  coffee),  foods high in histamines, and spicy foods. [14]\n\nMedications  and  topical  irritants  have  also  been  known  to  trigger rosacea  flares.  Some  acne  and  wrinkle  treatments  reported  to  cause rosacea  include  microdermabrasion  and  chemical  peels,  as  well  as high dosages of isotretinoin, benzoyl peroxide, and tretinoin.\n\nSteroid-induced rosacea is caused by topical use of steroids, [15]  which are  often  prescribed  for  seborrheic  dermatitis.  Dosage  should  be slowly decreased and not stopped abruptly to avoid a flare-up.\n\n\n## Cathelicidins\n\nIn  2007,  Richard  Gallo  and  colleagues  noticed  that  patients  with rosacea had high levels of cathelicidin, an antimicrobial peptide, [16]  and elevated levels of stratum corneum tryptic  enzymes  (SCTEs).  Antibiotics  have  been  used  in  the  past  to  treat  rosacea,  but  they  may  only  work because they inhibit some SCTEs. [16]\n\n\n## Demodex folliculitis and Demodex mites\n\nStudies of rosacea and Demodex mites have revealed that some people with rosacea have increased numbers of the mite, [14]  especially those with steroid-induced rosacea. Demodex folliculitis (demodicidosis, also known as \"mange\" in animals) is a condition that may have a \"rosacea-like\" appearance. [17]\n\nA  2007,  National  Rosacea  Society-funded  study  demonstrated  that Demodex folliculorum mites  may  be  a cause  or  exacerbating  factor  in  rosacea. [18]   The  researchers  identified Bacillus  oleronius as  a  distinct bacterium  associated  with Demodex mites.  When  analyzing  blood  samples  using  a  peripheral  blood mononuclear  cell  proliferation  assay,  they  discovered  that B.  oleronius stimulated  an  immune  system response in 79 percent of 22 patients with subtype 2 (papulopustular) rosacea, compared with only 29% of 17 subjects without the disorder. They concluded, \"The immune response results in inflammation, as evident in the papules (bumps) and pustules (pimples) of subtype 2 rosacea. This suggests that the B. oleronius bacteria found in the mites could be responsible for the inflammation associated with the condition.\" [18]\n\n\n## Intestinal bacteria\n\nSmall  intestinal  bacterial  overgrowth  (SIBO)  was  demonstrated  to  have  a  greater  prevalence  in  rosacea patients,  and  treating  it  with  locally  acting  antibiotics  led  to  rosacea  lesion  improvement  in  two  studies. Conversely, in rosacea patients who were SIBO-negative, antibiotic therapy had no effect. [19]  The effectiveness of treating SIBO in rosacea patients may suggest that gut bacteria play a role in the pathogenesis of rosacea lesions."

        "text": "# Diagnosis\n\nMost people with rosacea have only mild redness and are never formally diagnosed or treated. No test for rosacea is known. In many cases, a simple visual inspection by a trained healthcare professional is sufficient for  diagnosis.  In  other  cases,  particularly  when  pimples  or  redness  on  less-common  parts  of  the  face  are present,  a  trial  of  common  treatments  is  useful  for  confirming  a  suspected  diagnosis.  The  disorder  can  be confused with or co-exist with acne vulgaris or seborrheic dermatitis. The presence of a rash on the scalp or ears suggests a different or co-existing diagnosis because rosacea is primarily a facial diagnosis, although it may occasionally appear in these other areas.\n\n\n## Classification\n\nFour rosacea subtypes exist, [21]  and a patient may have more than one subtype: [22]:  176\n\n\n- Erythematotelangiectatic rosacea exhibits permanent redness (erythema) with a tendency to flush and blush easily. [ 14 ]  Also small, widened blood vessels visible near the surface of the skin (telangiectasias) and possibly intense burning, stinging, and itching are common. [14]  People with this type often have sensitive skin. Skin can also become very dry and flaky. In addition to the face, signs can also appear on the ears, neck, chest, upper back, and scalp. [23]\n- Papulopustular rosacea presents with some permanent redness with red bumps (papules); some pus-filled pustules can last 1-4 days or longer. This subtype is often confused with acne.\n- Phymatous rosacea is most commonly associated with rhinophyma, an enlargement of the nose. Signs include thickening skin, irregular surface nodularities, and enlargement. Phymatous rosacea can also affect the chin (gnathophyma), forehead (metophyma), cheeks, eyelids (blepharophyma), and ears (otophyma). [24]  Telangiectasias may be present.\n- In ocular rosacea , a ff ected eyes and eyelids may appear red due to telangiectasias and inflammation, and may feel dry, irritated, or gritty. Other symptoms include foreign-body sensations, itching, burning, stinging, and sensitivity to light. [ 25 ]  Eyes can become more susceptible to infection. About half of the people with subtypes 1-3 also have eye symptoms. Keratitis is a rare complication that is characterized by blurry vision and vision loss as the cornea is affected.

        "text": "- Pyoderma faciale , also known as rosacea fulminans , [ 27 ]  is a conglobate, nodular disease that arises abruptly on the face. [12][27]\n- Rosacea conglobata is a severe rosacea that can mimic acne conglobata, with hemorrhagic nodular abscesses and indurated plaques. [27]\n- Phymatous rosacea is a cutaneous condition characterized by overgrowth of sebaceous glands. [12] Phyma is Greek for swelling, mass, or bulb, and these can occur on the face and ears. [27]:  693\n\n\n\n## Treatment\n\nThe type of rosacea that a person has will indicate the choice of treatment. [28]  Mild cases are often not treated at all, or are simply covered up with normal cosmetics.\n\nTherapy  for  the  treatment  of  rosacea  is  not  curative  and  is  best  measured  in  terms  of  a  reduction  in  the amount of facial redness and inflammatory lesions, a decrease in the number, duration, and intensity of flares, and  concomitant  symptoms  of  itching,  burning,  and  tenderness.  The  two  primary  modalities  of  rosacea treatment  are  topical  and  oral  antibiotic  agents. [29]   Laser  therapy  has  also  been  classified  as  a  form  of treatment. [29]   While  medications  often  produce  a  temporary  remission  of  redness  within  a  few  weeks,  the redness typically returns shortly after treatment is suspended. Long-term treatment, usually 1-2 years, may result in permanent control of the condition for some patients. [29][30]  Lifelong treatment is often necessary, although some cases resolve after a while and go into permanent remission. [30]  Other cases, if left untreated, worsen over time. [31]  Some people have also reported better results after changing diet. This is not confirmed by medical studies, even though some studies relate the histamine production to outbreak of rosacea. [32]\n\n\n## Behavior\n\nCertain  behavioral  changes  may  improve  the  symptoms  of  rosacea  or  prevent  exacerbations.  Keeping  a symptoms diary to  document  potential  symptom  triggers  and  avoiding  those  triggers  is  recommended. [26] Common exacerbating triggers include ultraviolet light and irritant cosmetics, therefore it is recommended that  those  with  rosacea  wear  sunscreen  (with  a  sun  factor  protection  (SPF)  of  30  or  greater)  and  avoid cosmetics. [26]   If  using  cosmetics  or  makeup  is  desired,  then  oil-free  foundation  and  concealer  should  be used. [26]  Skin astringents, products that can dry the skin and impair the skin barrier, including products with alcohol, menthol, peppermint, camphor, or eucalyptus oil, should generally be avoided. People should avoid using exfoliating skin scrubs, cosmetics, or soaps containing sodium laureth sulfate, or waterproof makeup on the affected area, as these products can compromise the skin barrier protection and be difficult to remove. [26] Using soap-free cleansers and non-oily moisturizers is preferred if used on the affected area. Many skin care products  have  been  specifically  formulated  for  those  with  sensitive  skin  or  those  with  conditions  such  as rosacea. [26]  Ocular rosacea may be treated with daily gentle eyelid washing using warm water, and artificial tears to lubricate the eye. [26]\n\nManaging pre-trigger events, such as prolonged exposure to cool environments, can directly influence warmroom flushing. [33]\n\n\n## Medications\n\nMedications  with  good  evidence  include  topical  metronidazole, [34][4]   ivermectin, [4]   brimonidine, [4]   and azelaic acid. [35] Good  evidence  medications taken by mouth  include brimonidine, doxycycline,  and isotretinoin, [35]   with  tetracyclines  such  as  doxycycline  representing  the  oral  medications  preferred  by  most clinicians. [4]   Lesser  evidence  supports  tetracycline  by  mouth. [35]   Isotretinoin  and  tetracycline  antibiotics, which may be used in more severe cases of inflammatory rosacea, are absolutely contraindicated in women who are pregnant, may become pregnant, or are lactating as they are highly teratogenic (associated with birth defects). Contraception is required for women of childbearing age who are using these medications. [26]"

        "text": "Metronidazole  is  thought  to  act  through  anti-inflammatory  mechanisms,  while  azelaic  acid  is  thought  to decrease cathelicidin production. Oral antibiotics of the tetracycline class, such as doxycycline, minocycline, and  oxytetracycline,  are  also  commonly  used  and  thought  to  reduce  papulopustular  lesions  through  antiinflammatory actions rather than through their antibacterial capabilities. [14]\n\nTopical  minocycline  applied  as  foam  is  a  newer  treatment  option  for  rosacea  that  the  FDA  has  approved. Minocycline  shows  a  targeted  approach  for  managing  inflammatory  lesions  of  rosacea  while  minimizing systemic side effects commonly associated with oral antibiotic use. It is available in foam formulation and is applied  to  the  affected  areas  once  daily.  Minocycline  belongs  to  the  tetracycline  family  of  antibiotics  and exhibits antimicrobial properties and anti-inflammatory activity, similar to other members of this class, such as  doxycycline.  Topical  minocycline  reduces  inflammatory  lesions  associated  with  rosacea;  however,  rare adverse events such as folliculitis have been reported. [34]\n\nTopical metronidazole is a commonly used treatment for rosacea; it is available in various formulations such as creams, gels, or lotions and applied to clean, dry skin once or twice daily. Topical metronidazole has been shown  to  effectively  reduce  inflammatory  lesions  and  perilesional  erythema  associated  with  rosacea  by inhibiting  both  microbial  growth  and  pro-inflammatory  mediators  generated  by  neutrophils.  Benefits  of topical metronidazole include its effectiveness in reducing symptoms, extensive clinical experience supporting its use, and generally good tolerability with minimal systemic side effects; still, some patients may experience mild  local irritation upon  initial  use,  and  it  may  have  limited  impact  on  persistent  facial  redness (erythema). [34]\n\nTopical azelaic acid is available in gel or cream formulations; it exerts its effects by reducing inflammation through its activity on the cathelicidin pathway, which is upregulated in rosacea-affected skin; it also reduces inflammatory lesions and improves overall symptoms of rosacea; it has been well-studied and shown to be effective in clinical trials; still, some patients may experience mild local irritation during the first few weeks of use. [34]\n\nOral Beta-blockers are often used for those with flushing due to rosacea. These include nadolol, propranolol or carvedilol. The possible adverse reactions of the oral beta-blockers include low blood pressure, low heart rate, or dizziness. [26] The  oral α-2 adrenergic receptor agonist clonidine can also be used for flushing symptoms. [26]   The  flushing  and  blushing  that  typically  accompany  rosacea  may  also  be  treated  with  the topical  application  of  alpha  agonists  such  as  brimonidine  which  has  vasoconstrictor  activity  and  achieves maximal symptom improvement 3-6 hours after application, other topicals  used  for  flushing  or  erythema include oxymetazoline or xylometazoline. [14]\n\nTopical ivermectin is a treatment option for rosacea that targets Demodex mites, which are associated with inflammation in the skin of patients with rosacea; the cream is applied once daily to clean, dry skin. Topical ivermectin has been shown to reduce Demodex mite density and improve cutaneous inflammatory markers in clinical  studies;  overall,  it  decreases  Demodex  mite  density  and  improves  the  symptoms  of  inflammation associated  with  rosacea;  however,  some  patients  may  experience  transient  burning  or  itching  upon application.  Topical  ivermectin  offers  a  targeted  approach  for  managing  rosacea  by  addressing  the  role  of Demodex mites in the disease process. [34]  A review found that ivermectin was more effective than alternatives for the treatment of papulopustular acne rosacea. [36][37]  An ivermectin cream has been approved by the FDA, as well as in Europe, for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea. The treatment is based upon the hypothesis that parasitic mites of the genus Demodex play a role in rosacea. [38]  In a clinical study, ivermectin reduced  lesions  by  83%  over  4  months,  as  compared  to  74%  under  a  metronidazole  standard  therapy. [39] Quassia amara extract at 4% demonstrated to have clinical efficacy for rosacea. [40]\n\nCyclosporin eye drops have been shown to reduce symptoms in those with ocular rosacea. Cyclosporin should not be used in those with an active ocular infection. [26]  Other options include topical metronidazole cream or topical fusidic acid applied to the eyelids, or oral doxycycline in more severe cases of ocular rosacea. If papules and pustules persist, then sometimes isotretinoin can be prescribed. [41]"

        "text": "Systemic doxycycline modified-release capsules are commonly used for the treatment of rosacea. The capsules are taken orally once daily, usually in a low dose, to achieve anti-inflammatory effects. [34]  Doxycycline acts by inhibiting  inflammation,  reducing  the  production  of  reactive  oxygen  species,  matrix  metalloproteases  and kallikrein 5 [42]  The benefits of systemic doxycycline include its effectiveness in reducing inflammatory lesions, improving erythema, and controlling symptoms related to ocular involvement in rosacea patients; it is also well-tolerated  at  lower  doses  compared  to  traditional  higher-dose  regimens  used  for  other  indications. However, potential cons include gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea or abdominal pain, photosensitivity  reactions  that  require  sun  protection  measures  during  treatment,  and  rare  instances  of antibiotic-associated diarrhea or bacterial resistance development with long-term use. [34]\n\nEncapsulated benzoyl peroxide (E-BPO) cream, a newly FDA-approved topical agent for inflammatory lesions of  rosacea,  utilizes  porous  silica  microcapsule  technology  to  slow  the  absorption  of  benzoyl  peroxide  and diminish potential irritation.
