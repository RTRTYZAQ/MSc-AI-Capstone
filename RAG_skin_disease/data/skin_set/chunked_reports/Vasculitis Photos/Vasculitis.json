        "text": "# Vasculitis\n\nVasculitis is a group of disorders that destroy blood vessels by inflammation. [2] Both arteries and veins are affected. Lymphangitis (inflammation of lymphatic vessels) is sometimes considered a type of vasculitis. [3]  Vasculitis is primarily caused by  leukocyte  migration  and  resultant  damage.  Although  both occur in vasculitides, inflammation  of  veins (phlebitis)  or arteries (arteritis) on their own are separate entities.\n\n\n## Signs and symptoms\n\nThe clinical presentation of the various vasculitides on the skin and  internal  organs  is  mostly  determined  by  the  diameter  or size of the vessels mainly affected. [4]  Non-specific symptoms are common and include fever, headache, fatigue, myalgia, weight loss, and arthralgia. [5][6]\n\nAll  forms  of  vasculitides,  even  large  vessel  vasculitides,  may cause skin manifestations. The most common skin manifestations include purpura, nodules, livedo reticularis, skin ulcers, and purpuric urticaria.

Although  infections  usually  involve  vessels  as  a component of more extensive tissue damage, they can also directly or indirectly cause vasculitic syndromes through  immune-mediated  secondary  events.  Simple  vascular  thrombosis  usually  only  affects  the  luminal process,  but  through  the  process  of  thrombus  organization,  it  can  also  occasionally  cause  a  more  chronic vasculitic syndrome. The autoimmune etiologies, a particular family of diseases characterized by dysregulated immune responses that produce particular pathophysiologic signs and symptoms, are more prevalent.

Any size artery could be impacted, though. [33]  The two primary types are polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) and Kawasaki disease (KD).

Typically, corticosteroids such as prednisone are used. Additionally, other immune suppression medications, such as cyclophosphamide, are considered. In case of an infection, antimicrobial agents including cephalexin may  be  prescribed.  Affected  organs  (such  as  the  heart  or  lungs)  may  require  specific  medical  treatment intended to improve their function during the active phase of the disease.",

        "text": "# Vasculitis\n\nVasculitis is a group of disorders that destroy blood vessels by inflammation. [2] Both arteries and veins are affected. Lymphangitis (inflammation of lymphatic vessels) is sometimes considered a type of vasculitis. [3]  Vasculitis is primarily caused by  leukocyte  migration  and  resultant  damage.  Although  both occur in vasculitides, inflammation  of  veins (phlebitis)  or arteries (arteritis) on their own are separate entities.\n\n\n## Signs and symptoms\n\nThe clinical presentation of the various vasculitides on the skin and  internal  organs  is  mostly  determined  by  the  diameter  or size of the vessels mainly affected. [4]  Non-specific symptoms are common and include fever, headache, fatigue, myalgia, weight loss, and arthralgia. [5][6]\n\nAll  forms  of  vasculitides,  even  large  vessel  vasculitides,  may cause skin manifestations. The most common skin manifestations include purpura, nodules, livedo reticularis, skin ulcers, and purpuric urticaria.

        "text": "# Causes\n\nThere  are  several  different  etiologies  for  vasculitides.  Although  infections  usually  involve  vessels  as  a component of more extensive tissue damage, they can also directly or indirectly cause vasculitic syndromes through  immune-mediated  secondary  events.  Simple  vascular  thrombosis  usually  only  affects  the  luminal process,  but  through  the  process  of  thrombus  organization,  it  can  also  occasionally  cause  a  more  chronic vasculitic syndrome. The autoimmune etiologies, a particular family of diseases characterized by dysregulated immune responses that produce particular pathophysiologic signs and symptoms, are more prevalent. [32]\n\n\n## Classification\n\nPrimary systemic, secondary, and single-organ vasculitides are distinguished using the highest classification level in the 2012 Chapel Hill Consensus Conference nomenclature. [33]\n\n\n## Primary systemic vasculitis\n\nPrimary  systemic  vasculitis  is  categorized  by  the  size  of  the  vessels  mainly  involved.  Primary  systemic vasculitis includes large-vessel vasculitis, medium-vessel vasculitides, small-vessel vasculitides, and variablevessel vasculitides. [33]\n\n\n## Large vessel vasculitis\n\nThe 2012 Chapel Hill Consensus Conference defines large vessel vasculitis (LVV) as a type of vasculitis that can  affect  any  size  artery.  It  usually  affects  the  aorta  and  its  major  branches  more  frequently  than  other vasculitides. [33]  Takayasu arteritis (TA) and giant cell arteritis (GCA) are the two main forms of LVV. [8]\n\n\n## Medium vessel vasculitis\n\nMedium vessel vasculitis (MVV) is a type of vasculitis that mostly affects the medium arteries, which are the major arteries that supply the viscera and their branches. Any size artery could be impacted, though. [33]  The two primary types are polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) and Kawasaki disease (KD). [8]\n\n\n## Small vessel vasculitis\n\nSmall vessel vasculitis (SVV) is separated into immune complex SVV and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV). [33]\n\nAntineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a necrotizing vasculitis linked to MPO-ANCA or PR3-ANCA that primarily affects small vessels and has few or no immune deposits. AAV is further classified as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). [33]\n\nImmune  complex  small  vessel  vasculitis  (SVV)  is  a  vasculitis  that  primarily  affects  small  vessels  and  has moderate  to  significant  immunoglobulin  and  complement  component  deposits  on  the  vessel  wall. [33] Normocomplementemic  urticarial  vasculitis  (HUV)  (anti-C1q  vasculitis),  cryoglobulinemic  vasculitis  (CV), IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein) (IgAV), and anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease are the categories of immune complex SVV. [8]\n\n\n## Variable vessel vasculitis\n\nVariable vessel vasculitis (VVV) is a kind of vasculitis that may impact vessels of all sizes (small, medium, and large) and any type (arteries, veins, and capillaries), with no particular type of vessel being predominantly affected. [33]  This category includes Behcet's disease (BD) and Cogan's syndrome (CS). [8]"

        "text": "# Secondary vasculitis\n\nThe subset of illnesses known as secondary vasculitides is believed to be triggered by an underlying ailment or exposure.  Systemic  illnesses  (such  as  rheumatoid  arthritis),  cancer,  drug  exposure,  and  infection  are  the primary causes of vasculitis; however, there are still a few factors that have a conclusively shown pathogenic relationship  to  the  condition. [34]   Vasculitis  frequently  coexists  with  infections,  and  several  infections, including hepatitis B and C, HIV, infective endocarditis, and tuberculosis, are significant secondary causes of vasculitis. [35]   Except  for  rheumatoid  vasculitis,  the  majority  of  secondary  vasculitis  forms  are  exceedingly rare. [36]\n\n\n## Single-organ vasculitis\n\nSingle-organ vasculitis, formerly known as \"localized\", \"limited\", \"isolated\", or \"nonsystemic\" vasculitis, refers to  vasculitis  that  is  limited  to  one  organ  or  organ  system.  Examples  of  this  type  of  vasculitis  include gastrointestinal, cutaneous, and peripheral nerve vasculitides. [34]\n\n\n## Diagnosis\n\n\n- Laboratory tests of blood or body fluids are performed for patients with active vasculitis. Their results will generally show signs of inflammation in the body, such as increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), anemia, increased white blood cell count and eosinophilia. Other possible findings are elevated antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) levels and hematuria.\n- Other organ functional tests may be abnormal. Specific abnormalities depend on the degree of organ involvement. A brain SPECT can show decreased blood flow to the brain and brain damage.\n- The definite diagnosis of vasculitis is established after a biopsy of involved organ or tissue, such as skin, sinuses, lung, nerve, brain, and kidney. The biopsy elucidates the pattern of blood vessel inflammation.\n- Some types of vasculitides display leukocytoclasis , which is vascular damage caused by nuclear debris from infi ltrating neutrophils. [ 37 ] It typically presents as palpable purpura. [37]  Conditions with leucocytoclasis mainly include hypersensitivity vasculitis (also called leukocytoclastic vasculitis) and cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis (also called cutaneous leukocytoclastic angiitis).\n- An alternative to biopsy can be an angiogram (x-ray test of the blood vessels). It can demonstrate characteristic patterns of inflammation in affected blood vessels.\n- 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT)has become a widely used imaging tool in patients with suspected Large Vessel Vasculitis, due to the enhanced glucose metabolism of inflamed vessel walls.
