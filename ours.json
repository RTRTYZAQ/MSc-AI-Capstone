  "{\n  \"Disease Name\": \"Actinic Keratosis\",\n  \"Symptom Description\": \"The skin lesion appears as a thick, scaly, or crusted plaque on sun-exposed skin, consistent with actinic keratosis. The lesion may be raised, erythematous, or exhibit varying degrees of inflammation and pigmentation.\",\n  \"Treatment Plan Recommendation\": \"Given the clinical presentation suggesting actinic keratosis, a biopsy is recommended to rule out invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). If confirmed as actinic keratosis, treatment options include topical 5-fluorouracil or imiquimod applied daily for several weeks, photodynamic therapy (PDT) using photosensitizer and strong light illumination, or systemic acitretin for transplant patients. Regular follow-up is advised to monitor for progression or recurrence.\"\n}",

These lesions may be associated with aging but are benign and typically not itchy or painful.\",\n  \"Treatment Plan Recommendation\": \"If lesions are asymptomatic, no treatment is necessary.

Initial management may include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids for symptom control. If secondary vasculitis is suspected, identify and treat underlying causes such as infections or drug reactions. Referral to a rheumatologist or dermatologist for further diagnostic workup (e.g., biopsy, blood tests) and possible immunosuppressive therapy is advised.\"\n}",

Supportive care including antihistamines for pruritus and topical emollients is recommended. If secondary infection is suspected, local hygiene and appropriate antibiotic therapy may be considered.

These lesions are likely to be non-blistering and more superficial, as pemphigoid predominantly involves epidermal separation and erosions rather than true bullae.\",\n  \"Treatment Plan Recommendation\": \"Immunosuppressive therapy including systemic corticosteroids and/or calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., prednisone or cyclosporine) is recommended for management. Topical agents such as topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors may also be used. If severe, systemic immunosuppression (e.g., azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) may be considered. Wound care is essential to prevent secondary infections. Avoid trauma to affected areas and maintain hydration.\"\n}"
