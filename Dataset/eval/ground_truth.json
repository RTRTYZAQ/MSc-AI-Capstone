Formerly considered a single species, Toxicodendron radicans , poison ivies are now generally treated as a complex of three separate species: T. radicans , T. rydbergii , and T. orientale . They are variable in appearance and habit, and despite its common name, it is not a \\\"true\\\" ivy ( Hedera ), but rather a member of the cashew and pistachio family (Anacardiaceae). Though T. radicans is commonly eaten by many animals and the seeds are consumed by birds, poison ivy is most often thought of as an unwelcome weed. It is well known for causing urushiol-induced contact dermatitis, an itchy, irritating, and sometimes painful rash, in most people who touch them.

[3] Vasculitis is primarily caused by leukocyte migration and resultant damage. Although both occur in vasculitides, inflammation of veins (phlebitis) or arteries (arteritis) on their own are separate entities. ## Signs and symptoms The clinical presentation of the various vasculitides on the skin and internal organs is mostly determined by the diameter or size of the vessels mainly affected. [4] Non-specific symptoms are common and include fever, headache, fatigue, myalgia, weight loss, and arthralgia. [5][6] All forms of vasculitides, even large vessel vasculitides, may cause skin manifestations. The most common skin manifestations include purpura, nodules, livedo reticularis, skin ulcers, and purpuric urticaria.

Kilovoltage x-ray beams are often used for these treatments and have the property that the maximum radiation dose occurs close to the skin surface.
